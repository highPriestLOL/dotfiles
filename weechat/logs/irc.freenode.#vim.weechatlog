2014-08-25 22:50:46	Raimondi	vimgor: vim-tiny
2014-08-25 22:50:46	vimgor	vim-tiny is the default Vim package for Debian/Ubuntu. It is built with a small feature set, no help, and is not intended to be used full-time. You most likely want to install a more capable package of the Vim editor. If you want gvim install the vim-gtk package, otherwise install the vim-nox package.
2014-08-25 22:50:51	Raimondi	StevePerk: ^
2014-08-25 22:51:17	StevePerk	E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version: let g:colors_name="zenburn"

2014-08-25 22:52:10	StevePerk	Exactly, vimgor... when I run :version I see that I'm running the "small version".  But obviously I don't need gvim, because this is a non-graphical server that I only access via SSH.  So "nox" is the package in between the two extremes?

2014-08-25 23:47:40	oscarvarto	Hi! I have very little vim experience. I have installed haskell-vim-now and now I am trying to install additional stuff following the instructions here: https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now#customizing  However, if I try to :set runtimepath=/Users/oscarvarto/.vim.local,$VIMRUNTIME the haskell stuff stops working. How can I install additional stuff with a custom pathogen location (e.g. ~/.vim.local/bundle?)
