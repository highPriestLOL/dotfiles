2015-04-01 18:46:00	shmup	Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a fanfiction by "Less Wrong" (a pen name of Eliezer Yudkowsky) with a premise that the orphaned Harry Potter has been raised by a scientist stepfather and now has the equivalent rationalist skill of roughly an 18-year-old Eliezer or thereabouts, i.e., massively flawed but still pretty darned impressive. Naturally the hero's challenges have been stepped up in difficulty as well.
