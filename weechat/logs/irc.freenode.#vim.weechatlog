2014-08-25 22:50:46	Raimondi	vimgor: vim-tiny
2014-08-25 22:50:46	vimgor	vim-tiny is the default Vim package for Debian/Ubuntu. It is built with a small feature set, no help, and is not intended to be used full-time. You most likely want to install a more capable package of the Vim editor. If you want gvim install the vim-gtk package, otherwise install the vim-nox package.
2014-08-25 22:50:51	Raimondi	StevePerk: ^
2014-08-25 22:51:17	StevePerk	E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version: let g:colors_name="zenburn"

2014-08-25 22:52:10	StevePerk	Exactly, vimgor... when I run :version I see that I'm running the "small version".  But obviously I don't need gvim, because this is a non-graphical server that I only access via SSH.  So "nox" is the package in between the two extremes?

2014-08-25 23:47:40	oscarvarto	Hi! I have very little vim experience. I have installed haskell-vim-now and now I am trying to install additional stuff following the instructions here: https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now#customizing  However, if I try to :set runtimepath=/Users/oscarvarto/.vim.local,$VIMRUNTIME the haskell stuff stops working. How can I install additional stuff with a custom pathogen location (e.g. ~/.vim.local/bundle?)

2014-09-01 18:56:01	FernandoBasso	So, I have a terminal open, and I do `vim index.php`. The project has over a hundred files. Even using tags I can't seem to easily navigate the project. How do you guys manage situations like this?
2014-09-01 18:56:27	romainl	with tags
2014-09-01 18:57:38	FernandoBasso	Well, perhaps I just don't get used to it, or it is not something that works for me...
2014-09-01 18:59:08	FernandoBasso	I am file handling buffers in vim, but I think I'd still prefer at least having the ability to open a buffer in a tabpage and make it stick there, so I would at least have a visual clue of the open files I have withouth having to type commands to see buffers previous to being able to switch to one of thme.

2014-09-09 14:31:26	croddy	aha ok

2014-09-10 15:28:48	Nugget	macvim, specifically, not just Gvim.  It's nice if you ever have to cut/paste from your vim to other os x apps.  tabbed editing is a bit more navigable.  it leverages the usual os x keyboard shortcuts your hands know
2014-09-10 15:28:59	Nugget	and it supports more than 256 colors which can be nice for some colorschemes
2014-09-10 15:29:25	Raimondi	if you build vim by hand or with macports/homebrew you get access to the clipboard from cli vim

Spend some quality time with your unembellished Vim to appreciate her simple beauty; vanilla, when done right, is a classy choice.

2014-09-13 15:06:30	paradigm	I don't see how that's different from my suggestion

2014-09-15 21:27:54	kwtm	frogonwheels: So, by way of explanation, I'd have   :map <Leader>keyseq1  :call MyCommentProcessingFunc()<CR>   which works as expected, except that another mapping is   :map <Leader>keyseq2  ,keyseq1,keyseq3,keyseq4     (and keyseq1 is also embedded in a number of other mappings).

2014-09-15 21:30:28	kwtm	frogonwheels: Historical reasons. I have about a hundred different mappings, which were easier to maintain when I was just starting Vim (and still are).  Is the only way to do this to eschew mappings altogether and use functions?  That wont' be practical until I have a week or so of spare time where I can rewrite the whole Vim file.

2014-09-17 22:31:51	AshyIsMe	then scratch itches as you find them, fugitive makes git really nice, etc

2014-09-18 23:13:59	_Cody	 thanks bairui
2014-09-18 23:14:03	bairui	yw
2014-09-18 23:15:00	bairui	_Cody: if new grammars is troubling for you, learn the grammar implicitly through phrases, rather than worry about explicit rules
2014-09-18 23:15:29	bairui	learning a foreign language through phrases (rather than individual words) is a much better approach

Use 'sudoedit' instead (on Mac OS X 'sudo -e'), this command runs Vim as the current user over a copy of the file and then replaces the original after the editing is finished. Add 'export EDITOR=vim' to your ~/.bashrc for sudoedit to use Vim.

2014-09-20 15:57:55	jamessan	h4k1m: are you exiting vim and then trying to paste?
2014-09-20 15:58:39	h4k1m	jamessan: yep
2014-09-20 15:58:40	jamessan	h4k1m: Basically, the way X selections work is that when you try to paste something, X asks the program that "owns" the selection what the actual data to paste is.  So, if you've exited vim or have vim suspended, then X can't talk to it.
2014-09-20 15:59:12	h4k1m	jamessan: oh I see. I'll try to let vim open and test it

2014-09-21 12:57:33	paradigm	I'm working on to many projects and followiwing to many other projects and it just kinda gets overwhelming.  For the time being I'm not really following neovim at all.  I figure either it'll still be around when I've got time for it, and so I can read up then, or it won't be, in which case I didn't miss anything.

2014-09-21 12:59:48	mhi^	zacts: I'm not sure how the API will look like, but many people seem to think that the scripting language for Neovim will be Lua, which is wrong. VimL will compiled with luajit, though. It will probably give extra speed to all existing VimL plugins without changing anything.

2014-09-22 20:38:34	vimgor	The vim that comes with OSX is 7.3  no patches and no clipboard support. Install homebrew ( http://brew.sh ) and then brew install vim. The vim formula follows debian unstable. Use brew install vim --HEAD to install the latest patches. For a graphical interface ask me about macvim. For tmux problems ask me about tmux-osx.

2014-09-27 13:25:52	vimgor	A slightly-maintained, buggy, over-complicated plugin intended to make it easier to author (La)Tex files. Often, this is better served by using a standalone snippets plugin (like snipMate) to define the snippets you actually find useful as well as using the command ':compiler tex' to allow using Vim's quickfix feature when compiling TeX to an output format.

When working in vim, if I exit edit mode with Esc and immediately try to move (with h,j,k,l) I get extra text pasted after my inserted text. It appears to paste whatever I last inserted, not what's in my paste buffer. Anyone have any idea what might cause that?

2014-10-04 15:55:56	romainl	there are new features… that not a single plugin uses

2014-10-04 15:59:24	ggVGc	wasamasa: right, but hacking togethera plugin for some other random thing is a lot easier than creating even a simple functioning syntax definition
2014-10-04 15:59:50	jamessan	ggVGc: depends on the syntax you're trying to highlight

2014-10-04 16:00:31	ggVGc	wasamasa: a syntax highlighting is done wrong when it for example marks everything red because you had an extra space at some point in your code and the regex rules fail in some way because of it

2014-10-11 18:33:14	mxdr	I'm trying to configure my Xdefaults file so that my vim color scheme matches my terminal well, by using the default vim color scheme. However I'm running into a problem with the keywords in the python syntax. I've tried changing all 16 colors and none of them effect it. They're still a dark brown.

2014-10-11 18:33:41	mxdr	I'd be willing to tweak the vim color scheme a bit if I have to, but the goal is to get one color scheme working for both vim and the terminal so it matches nicely inside tmux
2014-10-11 18:34:58	shurnormal	How come Vim tells [converted][dos] after opening and reading a file?

2014-10-14 20:09:20	sbrg	Is there any easy way for me to know what a plugin is running? In this particular scenario, ghcmod-vim is running ghc-mod and it's not able to parse its output, and the error message it's giving me is incomplete

2014-10-15 21:59:56	kingedgar	>.>?
2014-10-15 22:00:02	OliverUv	basically it records everything you do into a register
2014-10-15 22:00:29	japh	then it sends it to the NSA

2014-10-15 22:00:42	OliverUv	e.g. if you press "qqAhello world!<esc>q" then you'll have "Ahelloworld!<esc>" in register q
2014-10-15 22:00:49	OliverUv	you can then press @q to replay those keystrokes
2014-10-15 22:01:38	OliverUv	i often do stuff like qq^f"aTEXT<esc>5jq
2014-10-15 22:01:47	OliverUv	then just go 20@q to repeat those keystrokes 20 times
2014-10-15 22:01:54	kingedgar	o-o and what is this used for, i mean like if you already typed it? or is it just cool
2014-10-15 22:01:57	kingedgar	ah
2014-10-15 22:02:17	OliverUv	in this case it'd go to the start of the line, then go to the next " char on the line, then insert the text TEXT, then go down five lines

2014-10-18 17:14:10	ZyX-I	RageYL: When doing the last step (“if ([{”) do not forget to use `let saved_matchpairs=&l:matchpairs | setlocal matchpairs&vim | try | normal! % | finally | let &l:matchpairs = saved_matchpairs | endtry`. `try|finally` is a bit of overkill, but saving and setting matchpairs is required because otherwise `%` is not guaranteed to work the way you expect it to. There is also fun with &cpoptions.

2014-10-18 17:15:54	ZyX-I	Actually this is the reason why I avoid using `normal`/`feedkeys()` as much as possible. You can easily run into a option that changes behavior of the command and I do not think anybody remembers them all.

2014-10-18 17:19:57	ZyX-I	RageYL: Working with `'`, `"` requires some filetype-specific database because in one place `'\''` is an error (second `'` interpreted as a start of new string), in some it is a string or character containing a single single quote (and in some languages it may even be a part of the identifier). Assuming syntax file is written correctly you may find `synID()` handy with dealing with this kind of issues.
2014-10-18 17:20:47	RageYL	ZyX-I, yep i know i can do some 'type' analyzing but i think i will go with something easy
2014-10-18 17:20:51	ZyX-I	AFAIK usually plugin authors use something like `synIDattr(synID(lnr, col, 1), 'name') =~? 'string'`.
2014-10-18 17:21:10	RageYL	i will just use a regex that search for the next " not preceded with a \

2014-10-18 17:26:02	ZyX-I	RageYL: Do not forget to use `\m\c` in regular expressions.

2014-10-19 20:28:37	evanton	well I don't want that, because it hurts
2014-10-19 20:28:42	average	that's why evil-mode is mature and really the best Vim compatibility layer out there today in 2014
2014-10-19 20:28:56	average	which is what I use
2014-10-19 20:29:09	average	evanton: also, keep in mind, this is coming from a Vim user like yourself

2014-10-19 23:14:10	Draconis	hey guys, window user here trying to get python support. I checked has('python') which returns 0. I suspected because my python is 64bit while vim is 32bit. So I downloaded the 64 bit binaries and verified it through version which also lists +python/dyn in there. However has('python') still returns 0. Is it possible to get it to work on 64bit?

2014-10-20 21:38:38	brucelee	and then shift-I
2014-10-20 21:38:45	paradigm	are the lines sequential?
2014-10-20 21:38:51	brucelee	yah sequential
2014-10-20 21:38:55	brucelee	but they arent same length
2014-10-20 21:38:59	brucelee	some are longer than others, and some are shorter
2014-10-20 21:39:02	paradigm	visual-block (what you described) is probably what I'd do as well

2014-10-21 00:00:12	abstrakt	phy1729, yep
2014-10-21 00:00:24	phy1729	pathogen is not as easy to manage for git-noobs

2014-10-21 00:00:56	phy1729	and since I don't need the flexibility of pathogen I use a simplier (in interface) plugin manager
2014-10-21 00:00:57	abstrakt	but, whatevs

2014-10-24 18:30:04	David	but I don't think there's much point once neovim comes out with the lua based engine

2014-10-24 18:36:43	romainl	I like how people who don't know much vim rally around neovim. The power of hyperbole and semi-empty promises is not to be underestimated
2014-10-24 18:37:33	David	I just want to see some effort into a decent graphical wrapper for vim

2014-10-24 18:37:56	zacts-	romainl: If it works(TM) for my ideas then I'll be happy with neovim.
2014-10-24 18:38:05	David	neovim is the best hope we have for that

2014-10-26 13:55:05	jamessan	Miesco: when a mapping is parsed, Vim will use g:mapleader as the value for <Leader> if it is defined.  Similarly, Vim will use g:maplocalleader for <LocalLeader> if it is defined.  It's just a way to help avoid buffer specific mappings from clashing with global mappings

2014-11-02 12:21:32	NID	Hi all. I'm trying to figure out how to temporarily hard wrap text. Hard wrapping is a pain when you need to edit a certain part of the text because you might need to format subsequent lines. Is there a way to temporarily hard wrap text (so that what's saved is actually one line) and allow me to edit particular lines without having to reformat the subsequent wrapped text?

2014-11-02 12:23:28	NID	The reason I don't want permmanent hard wrapping is because I sometimes use terminals with different widths and I want vim to wrap the text to my specific width.

2014-11-02 14:05:20	hseg	Although it also works without the question mark for string and number options.
2014-11-02 14:05:23	hseg	Shoot.
2014-11-02 14:06:41	ynix	hseg: I have this function that I call when I want to use 3 space indents (for a class in college). But sometimes I need to switch back to the default. How do I write a function to return these three to their default values? I don't know what they are initially. https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/07211d92bac58b3aea88/raw/b519f09c9e0766ae3397abf42749aa3f707dead0/gistfile1.txt
2014-11-02 14:06:55	ynix	What I mean to say is, is there a better way than just writing another function?

2014-11-02 21:02:56	grogoreo	I'm looking to make settings for a number of filetypes e.g. au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt,*.fountain set nonumber but I was wondering if I could change them per their established filetype. The reason is for Markdown you can use a number of extensions (md,mkd,mkdn,mark) so instead of typing every variation could I do something like au! BufRead,BufNewFile text,fountain,markdown set nonumber ?
2014-11-02 21:02:57	whoever	goldenwest: i did get it to work.. at least for html if all your tags are on the same line nothing will happen, but when they are on seperate lines , you will see the indent

2014-11-04 21:04:58	josephndenton	abstrakt: Rails is just a good example of using splits. You can write code, run tests, see results and logs from one terminal window.

2014-11-04 22:58:59	vimgor	There is nothing wrong with Vim distributions (spf13, cream, janus, etc.) per se, but when a distribution tries to simplify everything, you could encounter problems (broken plugins, weird mappings) that wouldn't occur with vanilla Vim. People in #vim generally don't like helping other people demystifing them. Also: http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1mygwg/vim_from_n00b_to_meh/ccdw5h8

2014-11-08 09:45:59	autrilla_	But I guess it takes time to learn :)
2014-11-08 09:46:01	simpleuser	I switched from sublime 1 month and a half ago
