2014-10-13 12:29:37	beach	I am often asked what MIR means in the context of Cleavir.  It means Medium-level Intermediate Representation, and here is an example of the program (let ((x 10)) (if (> x 5) 1 2)) in MIR: http://metamodular.com/mir-example.png
2014-10-13 12:30:34	nyef	beach: And you have the tools to dump MIR to that format, right?

2014-10-13 12:32:06	ggole	What's <-?
2014-10-13 12:32:14	beach	Assignment instruction.

2014-10-13 12:32:23	beach	White boxes are instructions.
2014-10-13 12:32:28	beach	Green is constant input.
2014-10-13 12:32:33	beach	Yellow is lexical variables.
2014-10-13 12:32:43	ggole	There's assignment even for free variables?
2014-10-13 12:32:46	beach	Hexagons are temporary.
2014-10-13 12:33:00	nyef	Being able to dump MIR through graphviz like that looks like it might be useful for debugging.
2014-10-13 12:33:05	beach	ggole: Yes.
2014-10-13 12:33:10	ggole	Hmm, interesting decision
2014-10-13 12:33:15	beach	nyef: For small examples yes.

2014-10-13 12:35:27	beach	Oh, > is a constant symbol.
2014-10-13 12:35:46	beach	Everything green is constant.
2014-10-13 12:36:06	beach	nyef: Yes, a gensymed temporary lexical variable.
2014-10-13 12:36:42	beach	There are a lot of unnecessary temporaries in there.  Those will be eliminated in later analyses.

2014-10-13 12:41:40	ggole	Input numbers, looks like
2014-10-13 12:41:41	beach	I had to number the inputs, outputs and successors, because I couldn't figure out how to make Graphviz render them in a particular order.
2014-10-13 12:41:55	drmeister	Got it.
2014-10-13 12:42:33	beach	I haven't put too much work into the rendering; only enough for me to be able to use it for debugging.
2014-10-13 12:43:47	drmeister	Black lines are flow of execution?
2014-10-13 12:44:10	beach	But I don't know what I would have done without it.  Using the inspector is not an option.  Too hard to remember the addresses of various instances between two inspector windows.
2014-10-13 12:45:04	ggole	You could generate text in a preorder pass over the graph easily enough
2014-10-13 12:45:25	ggole	On the other hand, printing dependencies as numbers and lining them up mentally probably isn't much easier.
2014-10-13 12:45:29	beach	A textual representation of the graph?  Sure.  I prefer this though.
2014-10-13 12:48:56	ggole	Hmm, graphviz has tooltips: you could make it pretty useful with a bit of work.
2014-10-13 12:49:06	ggole	Probably a good choice.

2014-10-13 12:50:19	isBEKaml	Hi, I got a question (somewhat silly): Let's say I got a defun like this -> (defun addn (x) #'(lambda (n) (+ x n)))
2014-10-13 12:50:22	beach	drmeister: I do, but I am thinking of doing that on the fly.
2014-10-13 12:50:50	drmeister	Isn't it more of a final, post-processing thing?
2014-10-13 12:50:55	isBEKaml	How would I use this addn ? I understand that it generates another function that takes a value for addition. But how would I invoke it to do so?
2014-10-13 12:51:04	beach	drmeister: It is trivial to do and it doesn't help much to keep the basic blocks around, because there will be a lot of modifications to them.
2014-10-13 12:51:28	isBEKaml	((addn 3) 42) --> should give me 45. Pardon the syntax-snafu. :-)

2014-10-13 15:23:42	jasom	took about 3 minutes just to startup abcl
2014-10-13 15:24:02	InvalidCo	jasom: sounds still doable...I once wrote a qbasic interpreter on js using regexes
2014-10-13 15:24:19	InvalidCo	I was going to this demoscene event and I wanted to make a qbasic demo which ran on js
2014-10-13 15:24:31	ack006	wow :-)
2014-10-13 15:24:46	InvalidCo	I made the mistake of developing the actual demo separately from the interpreter
2014-10-13 15:24:46	jasom	numeric code seems particularly slow; 51s to calculate 10000 fibonacci number versus 0.1s on native jvm abcl
2014-10-13 15:24:52	InvalidCo	and the interpreter was just too slow
2014-10-13 15:25:07	InvalidCo	the deadline closed in so we just decided to show it as a qbasic demo
2014-10-13 15:25:36	InvalidCo	in my defense, I was slightly intoxicated for those few days and thought that I could pull it off

2014-10-15 21:05:41	InvalidCo	the different equality-operators are there because type mismatch can produce surprising results

2014-10-15 21:08:25	InvalidCo	but in C, you use, for example, strcmp to compare strings
2014-10-15 21:08:29	Bike	with a single equality operator, the thing is that sometimes you want two things to compare equal and for other applications you might want those same things to not compare equal.

2014-10-24 16:10:13	DickGates	pjb:I see. Would such a distro attract funds though?
2014-10-24 16:10:34	pjb	It's a difficult question.
2014-10-24 16:11:35	pjb	Perhaps the mathematical expectancy is higher of having a lisper making a fortune (like a few did, cf Paul Graham, or (I assume) people at ITA), and using the funds to develop a Lisp OS, just like Armstrong did with Ubuntu.
2014-10-24 16:12:10	pjb	I'd think that most of us think so, since we're I still assume, all busy working on our lisp start ups ;-)
2014-10-24 16:12:30	nyef	I have one, very simple, question for all of the "let's make an all-lisp linux distro" people: aren't there already enough pieces out there to construct a basic system? SBCL as /bin/init, use the sysinit file to bring in whatever else, run-program to get an X server started, fire up stumpwm or something, and go?
2014-10-24 16:12:40	pjb	The problem is that we're too smart to think about easy dumb stuff like an Yo! application.
2014-10-24 16:13:05	pjb	nyef: yes, there are a lot of pieces. Hence the project we're discussing now.
2014-10-24 16:13:31	prxq	it would be fun. but stumpwm is really an acquired taste, afaict
2014-10-24 16:14:06	H4ns	quite some stuff needs to be written in order to fully boot a system
2014-10-24 16:14:18	H4ns	i.e. fs mounting, network configuration and the like.
2014-10-24 16:14:19	pjb	I may have introduced some confusion by saying "Lisp OS".  Beach's Lisp OS project would be an entirely different kernel.  My "LEP" project is a Lisp user land over unix kernel thing.
2014-10-24 16:14:27	H4ns	not too hard, but time consuming
2014-10-24 16:14:28	jdz	rewrite systemd in lisp!
2014-10-24 16:14:33	H4ns	\o/
2014-10-24 16:14:39	pjb	But from the user point of view both systems could be close enough.
2014-10-24 16:14:43	jdz	everybody will welcome lisp, then
2014-10-24 16:14:59	H4ns	right.  and torvalds will go just bonkers
2014-10-24 16:15:22	pjb	Well, if systemd spreads too much I might switch to openbsd.
2014-10-24 16:16:22	jdz	pjb: why wait?
2014-10-24 16:16:35	pjb	That said, LEP, even if using a unix kernel, may be quite different from a usual unix system (like Android is quite different).
2014-10-24 16:16:49	pjb	jdz: for a unix system, I like the simplicity of BSD boot scripts.

2014-10-24 16:19:12	Ryan_Burnside	Speaking of Lisp in GNU/Linux, does anyone recall a chart saying roughly how much of each language the software represents?

2014-10-24 16:20:37	Ryan_Burnside	Everyone is running scared of Lisp (save the Clojure kids) because of "Scary Parens Syndrome or SPS".

2014-10-24 19:03:32	rak[1]	i'd likely take the short way around and just use ext:run-program to call the shells ssh

2014-10-24 19:10:39	JokesOnYou77	rak[1], I meant a .lisp.  I'm using uiop to run an external script but I would like what I write to be more-or-less portable but uiop only seems to be able to call the script with an absolute path.

2014-10-27 21:50:32	pjb	This week somebody wrote a Spreadsheet in 30 lines of Javscript.
2014-10-27 21:50:57	Ryan_Burnside	Lisp is the perfect language for spreadsheets since you are often working with collections and applied functions to begin with.
2014-10-27 21:51:21	pjb	Ryan_Burnside: you may inspire yourself with Improv.  Or have a look at the sources of SES (port it from emacs lisp to Common Lisp ?)
2014-10-27 21:51:26	Zhivago	Qualifications shared by many other languages, some actually designed for use with spreadsheets. :)
2014-10-27 21:51:48	Zhivago	Not to say that lisp isn't a good language for spreadsheets, but perfect is going a bit far.

2014-10-30 20:59:26	linux_dream	hey guys which IDE would you suggest to a newbie in lisp and programming in general?  I have geany, gedit, etc.
2014-10-30 20:59:40	linux_dream	but I cannot make some code work with the terminal
2014-10-30 20:59:47	nyef	linux_dream: emacs.
2014-10-30 21:00:13	linux_dream	thank you.. emacs alone?
2014-10-30 21:00:17	stassats	there's only one ide, like it or not
2014-10-30 21:00:23	linux_dream	emacs?
2014-10-30 21:00:40	nyef	Some people would recommend using slime with emacs if you're going to be doing lisp stuff, but emacs alone is sufficient.
2014-10-30 21:00:55	BitPuffin	linux_dream: well emacs is easily the king of lisp
2014-10-30 21:01:03	stassats	emacs is necessary, but not sufficient
2014-10-30 21:01:03	linux_dream	ok thanks guys I'm getting it
2014-10-30 21:01:11	linux_dream	not sufficient?
2014-10-30 21:01:13	BitPuffin	lol
2014-10-30 21:01:36	nyef	If emacs isn't sufficient, slime is overkill.
2014-10-30 21:01:40	BitPuffin	it's built for lisp in lisp :P, that's why it's got commands such as mark-defun
2014-10-30 21:01:56	nyef	Just beware of kill-sexp-backwards. (-:
2014-10-30 21:01:56	BitPuffin	slime is great
2014-10-30 21:02:16	linux_dream	well I'm getting emacs right now. hope it's enough
2014-10-30 21:02:29	BitPuffin	though every time I say slime and swank to any of my friends they laugh :/
2014-10-30 21:03:07	BitPuffin	linux_dream: it's enough, don't worry
2014-10-30 21:03:17	linux_dream	ok thanks
2014-10-30 21:03:24	stassats	i wouldn't be using CL if it were not for slime
2014-10-30 21:03:26	BitPuffin	prepare to be scared of some of the keybindings though
2014-10-30 21:03:31	BitPuffin	keep in mind that it started in like
2014-10-30 21:03:34	BitPuffin	the 70s?
2014-10-30 21:03:39	linux_dream	when I save a file in which I entered lisp commands, I save it as .lisp?  or just .txt
2014-10-30 21:03:39	BitPuffin	think it was mid 70s
2014-10-30 21:03:41	BitPuffin	so
2014-10-30 21:03:47	BitPuffin	to save you do ctrl+x ctrl+s
2014-10-30 21:03:50	BitPuffin	instead of just ctrl+s
2014-10-30 21:03:55	linux_dream	ok
2014-10-30 21:03:59	BitPuffin	you can use cua-mode to get more typical stuff
2014-10-30 21:04:02	BitPuffin	but I advice you not to

2014-10-30 22:01:59	stassats	it doesn't even signal, it just completely bonkers, so much time spent looking for the "WARNING:" in the output
2014-10-30 22:02:10	Xach	I will commit a fix to clx tomorrow
2014-10-30 22:02:54	stassats	and like, when there's something broken, you don't know which file it is right away, and have to fish it out of the backtrace and try to C-x C-f it, argh, hate hate

2014-10-31 18:58:13	Bicyclidine	then you should have a function that checks the type of the first element of the list, and calls itself recursive if it is a list

2014-11-02 15:15:28	drmeister	I recently installed emacs 24.4 and find that indenting is a bit screwy.
2014-11-02 15:15:43	drmeister	Does anyone know why multiple-value-bind is indenting like this?

2014-11-02 15:22:25	drmeister	It's funny because everything else is indenting properly as far as I have tested it.

2014-11-02 17:33:04	puchacz	hi, I am reading bordeaux threads api docs, and I do not understand this "Global bindings are shared between threads: the initial value of a global variable in the new thread will be the same as in the parent,"
2014-11-02 17:33:07		theBlackDragon (~dragon@77.109.96.80.adsl.dyn.edpnet.net) has joined #lisp
2014-11-02 17:33:23	puchacz	so, if I have (defvar *boo* 3) or (defparameter *boo* 3) and then (let ((*boo* 4)) bt:make-thread in another function
2014-11-02 17:33:43	puchacz	does it fall under "global bindings" category please?
2014-11-02 17:33:54	puchacz	the docs is here: http://trac.common-lisp.net/bordeaux-threads/wiki/ApiDocumentation

2014-11-02 17:34:35	puchacz	the last point "Local bindings in the the caller of MAKE-THREAD may or may not be shared" - I understand it is about variables introduced with (let ..) only, correct?
2014-11-02 17:34:37	|3b|	LET makes a non-global binding. if i remember right bt doesn't specify what happens
2014-11-02 17:34:43	|3b|	right
2014-11-02 17:34:57	|3b|	well, LET and anything else except DEFVAR or DEFPARAMETER
2014-11-02 17:35:38	puchacz	|3b| let on nonglobal symbol, function arguments etc - same thing, local bindings
2014-11-02 17:35:54	puchacz	but is let on global symbol still a local binding?
2014-11-02 17:36:07		svetlyak40wt (~art@77.232.152.131) has joined #lisp
2014-11-02 17:36:11	|3b|	any binding created by LET is local, regardless of name
2014-11-02 17:36:19	|3b|	and same for functions, etc
2014-11-02 17:36:28	|3b|	DEFVAR and DEFPARAMETER create a global binding
2014-11-02 17:36:59	|3b|	other bindings of same name create a local binding that shadows the global binding
2014-11-02 17:37:48	puchacz	ok, and when I use LET on a nonglobal symbol, it is visible only in lexical scope. if I use LET on DEFVARed or DEFPAREMETERed symbol, it is visible with my new LETed value down the stack call providing functions being called are in source files after DEFVAR or DEFPARAMETER. do I understand it correctly?
2014-11-02 17:39:19	dim	puchacz: I think you need to think in terms of "binding" rather than "symbol" here

2014-11-02 17:40:41	puchacz	dim: did I describe correct behaviour? LET on something that has DEFVARed binding changes the value to LETed one all the way down the call stack providing the functions are physically in source file after DEFVAR. If they are before DEFVAR, they still see the value bound by DEFVAR
2014-11-02 17:40:53	--	baetheus is now known as zz_baetheus
2014-11-02 17:41:20	dim	it's called “dynamic binding” and you will find plenty of references to it, and it's also quite easy to test it
2014-11-02 17:41:32	|3b|	puchacz: you can declare a binding to be 'special' in a let even if it doesn't have a global DEFVAR/DEFPARAMETER binding and it will work the same way

2014-11-02 17:42:00	--	zz_baetheus is now known as baetheus
2014-11-02 17:42:02	puchacz	|3b| really? I think I get sbcl warning without prior DEFVAR or DEFPARAMETER
2014-11-02 17:42:17	puchacz	|3b| right, bindings are global not symbols
2014-11-02 17:42:25	|3b|	DEFVAR/DEFPPARAMETER just globally declaim that symbol to name a special (= dynamic) variable
2014-11-02 17:42:45	puchacz	ok, so without it, will work but with sbcl warning?
2014-11-02 17:43:22	|3b|	you can do that yourself without creating a global binding with DECLAIM or PROCLAIM, or you can just always use DECLARE SPECIAL locally
2014-11-02 17:43:32	puchacz	got you
2014-11-02 17:43:46	|3b|	will what work?
2014-11-02 17:44:04	puchacz	no, I am checking the wording of bt docs now

2014-11-02 17:44:09	puchacz	with better understanding
2014-11-02 17:44:19	dim	the main difference is that when using defvar/defparameter it's then no longer possible to use the same symbol for a lexically scoped binding
2014-11-02 17:44:44	dim	hence the habit of using ear muffs, ala (defvar *x* 'foo)
2014-11-02 17:45:52	puchacz	ok, so DEFVAR/DEFPARAMETER/DECLARE SPECIAL/DECLAIM/PROCLAIM etc. and then LET  to create a dynamic binding. Is dynamic binding called local or global?
2014-11-02 17:46:12	|3b|	either
2014-11-02 17:46:24	|3b|	DEFVAR/DEFPARAMETER make global bindings, everything else local
2014-11-02 17:46:36		ykm (~AndChat61@106.77.157.64) has joined #lisp
2014-11-02 17:46:51	dim	“dynamic extent” is the techincal detail IIRC
2014-11-02 17:46:52	puchacz	|3b| so LET is local, no matter if it is lexical scope only or dynamic binding?
2014-11-02 17:46:58	|3b|	right
2014-11-02 17:47:10	dim	(let ((x 2)) (declare (special x)) (foo x))
2014-11-02 17:47:25	|3b|	though the BT stuff was only about special/dynamic bindings not lexical bindings
2014-11-02 17:47:26	dim	now x is a lexical binding with a dynamic extent reaching into foo
2014-11-02 17:47:51	puchacz	dim - you did not have to pass it as an argument, did you?
2014-11-02 17:47:57	dim	right
2014-11-02 17:48:21	|3b|	since you create the closure in the calling thread, and nothing else could see a lexical bindings in the newly created thread anyway
2014-11-02 17:48:47	puchacz	|3b| see the URL I pasted - it uses words global and local, not dynamic and not lexical
2014-11-02 17:49:35	puchacz	which makes me worried - because the only way to pass a value to a new thread may be to use a global variable
2014-11-02 17:49:40	|3b|	"The interaction between threads and dynamic variables is in some cases complex,..."
2014-11-02 17:49:46	|3b|	so only about dynamic variables
2014-11-02 17:49:47	puchacz	yes, this part
2014-11-02 17:50:03	puchacz	"Local bindings are local to the thread they are introduced in"
2014-11-02 17:50:04	|3b|	and you can't make global lexical variables
2014-11-02 17:50:28	puchacz	|3b| there is no word "lexical" there
2014-11-02 17:50:43	puchacz	it only says - use global variables if you want to share between threads
2014-11-02 17:50:46	 *	|3b| reads the formatting as that being extra details on the complexity of special variables
2014-11-02 17:51:03	|3b|	so if a /dynamic/ variable is global or local ...
2014-11-02 17:51:33	|3b|	it doesn't matter for lexical bindings, since nothing could see them anyway
2014-11-02 17:52:10	dim	for multi threading (and with bordeaux-threads) don't bind the dynamic variable in the parent thread, only in the worker thread
2014-11-02 17:52:22	dim	or use lparallel and queues to communicate
2014-11-02 17:52:50	puchacz	I see - so there is no way to pass "local" variable to a newly created thread, is there?
2014-11-02 17:53:12	puchacz	hint: I use sbcl :-)
2014-11-02 17:56:05	dim	yes you can, see the kernel bindings API in lparallel
2014-11-02 17:56:25	puchacz	dim: so I should switch from bt to lparallel, shouldn't I?
2014-11-02 17:56:42	dim	lparallel depends on bt

2014-11-02 17:56:59	dim	it's not so much switching as expanding to an higher level lib
2014-11-02 17:57:09	puchacz	dim: I can imagine, and all the way down they all depend on sb-thread when running on sbcl
2014-11-02 17:57:17	puchacz	but it seems that it solved the problem that bt did not
2014-11-02 17:57:19	dim	I'm quite fond of lparallel myself, using it in pgloader
2014-11-02 17:58:58	puchacz	dim: do you know if bt on sbcl *happens* to pass on local bindings? my code seems to be working, but it may have been an accident
2014-11-02 17:59:21	puchacz	I will switch to lparallel though, but as a dirty solution, I am pretty happy to carry on with non-portable code for now
2014-11-02 17:59:32	dim	depends on the version of bt, 0.8.x is ok, 0.2.x is not, to make the case simpler than it is
2014-11-02 17:59:41	dim	beware than debian stable still has 0.2.x

2014-11-02 18:08:37	puchacz	|3b| and lexical bindings, ok we both understand that they are local, but dim said they will work in bt 0.8, so you say I can ignore the warning "don't use locals" in bt api, right?

I needed to (make-pathname :directory '(:absolute) :name "image" :type "bundle") if I want image.bundle to always be in the top directory when I merge it with a host name.  If the directory component is nil it was getting filled in by *default-pathname-defaults*.

I think I can do it by using the standard PRE technique for finding the places where instructions have to be inserted, and then using local rewrite rules to replicate the code.  This technique must be tested and proven of course.

2014-11-05 17:59:29	didi	Suppose I have a project with two files: `macros.lisp' and `functions.lisp'. I set up for ASDF to first load `macros.lisp' and then `functions.lisp'. All good so far. But now, suppose I want to use a function from `functions.lisp' inside a macro in `macros.lisp'. Do I have to do something special about it?

2014-11-08 09:25:38	Xach	beach: It is because it does not build for me
2014-11-08 09:25:46	Xach	beach: Component CLIM-CLX not found
2014-11-08 09:26:16	beach	Hmm.
2014-11-08 09:26:22	beach	I don't get that error.
2014-11-08 09:26:52	Xach	Where is CLIM-CLX defined?
2014-11-08 09:27:04	beach	Hold on...
2014-11-08 09:27:06	Xach	Is it in clim-clx.asd, or somewhere else?
2014-11-08 09:27:51	beach	mcclim.asd
2014-11-08 09:28:48	beach	This is strange though.  I can build mcclim, and I can run the demos, and I don't get the clim-clx problem.  I did this from a fresh user account.
2014-11-08 09:28:49	Xach	beach: it looks to me like my system is trying to find clim-clx before it loads mcclim.asd
2014-11-08 09:29:13	beach	It is scary that we don't get the same error.
2014-11-08 09:29:23	Xach	beach: which seems reasonable, as clim-clx is the first element in the :depends-on list of mcclim-truetype
2014-11-08 09:29:38	Xach	I will try reordering to see if that makes any difference.
2014-11-08 09:30:08	Xach	beach: so if you start from a fresh system with mcclim systems in your asdf source registry, (asdf:load-system "mcclim-truetype") signals no error?

2014-11-08 09:30:26	beach	Yes it does.
2014-11-08 09:30:35	beach	Maybe I am misremembering.  I was under the impression that it couldn't find the mcclim-truetype system.
2014-11-08 09:30:35	Xach	May I see a transcript?
2014-11-08 09:31:12	beach	I shall have to do that offline.  This Ubuntu installation is so screwy, and it messes everything up when I change the user.
2014-11-08 09:31:22	beach	I'll do it later, and give you a full report.
2014-11-08 09:32:13	Xach	beach: On my system, if mcclim preceds clim-clx in :depends-on, it builds fine. clim-clx may also be omitted.
2014-11-08 09:32:36	Xach	beach: depending on systems that cannot be found via find-system from a fresh start seems like trouble to me.
2014-11-08 09:32:54	beach	And find-system relies on the file name?
2014-11-08 09:32:57	Xach	yes.
2014-11-08 09:33:00	beach	Got it.
2014-11-08 09:33:19	beach	With this information, I'll try again and see what i get.
2014-11-08 09:33:38	beach	Would it be a better idea to have a separate file for each system?
2014-11-08 09:33:47	beach	... where the names correspond?
2014-11-08 09:34:19	Xach	I think that is a more reliable way to arrange systems.
2014-11-08 09:34:39	beach	Good, I'll do that.  But whether it is in a subdirectory doesn't matter?
2014-11-08 09:35:41	Xach	Not to Quicklisp.
2014-11-08 09:35:52	beach	Excellent!  Thanks.

2014-11-08 09:44:26	Xach	some are to be expected, because for example i don't build with CCL
2014-11-08 09:45:22	beach	Yeah, OK.
2014-11-08 09:46:27	beach	Also, installing McCLIM with Quicklisp did not install cl-vectors and zbp-ttf.
2014-11-08 09:46:31	beach	Is that for the same reason?
2014-11-08 09:46:46	beach	Those are dependent on by mcclim-truetype.

2014-11-08 09:49:45	stassats	so, it's the same .asd file thing after all
2014-11-08 09:49:48	Xach	beach: Do you mean that (ql:quickload "mcclim-truetype") does not fetch the required systems?
2014-11-08 09:50:07	beach	stassats: mcclim-truetype is a different one, but clim-clx is the same one.
2014-11-08 09:50:13	stassats	right
2014-11-08 09:50:32	beach	Xach: No, I mean (ql:quickload "mcclim") doesn't.
2014-11-08 09:52:01	Xach	beach: does mcclim depend on mcclim-truetype?
2014-11-08 09:52:06	beach	no
2014-11-08 09:52:20	beach	I guess that's normal then, and they will be fetched when mcclim-truetype is fetched.
2014-11-08 09:52:37	Xach	beach: that is the idea. sometimes there are bugs and it does not work. but in general, it should fetch what it needs.
2014-11-08 09:53:02	beach	I think I got it.  Sorry for my ignorance about how Quicklisp works. :(
2014-11-08 09:53:31	Xach	No problem. If there were docs, and if they were any good, it would be easier to be impatient about it.
2014-11-08 09:53:38	Xach	Sadly there aren't any.
2014-11-08 09:53:53	beach	Maybe one day.
