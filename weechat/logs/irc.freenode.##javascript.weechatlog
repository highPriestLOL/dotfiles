2014-11-04 20:44:43	j201_	so read the docs for your completion system and use whatever method you like (grep, vim macros, scripts, whatever) to scrape the function and object names from the relevant .d.ts files
2014-11-04 20:44:46	ljharb	!this @ mazde
2014-11-04 20:44:46	ecmabot	mazde: If a function call is of the form `a.b()`, `this` will be the object you accessed the "b" property from. Otherwise, if it's of the form `a()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function isn't in strict mode. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/

2014-11-07 21:10:33	wormmd	You need to think about execution again. Returning false short-circuited your code. Also, ternary expressions expect a single argument for each of their cases, so you'd need to wrap the cases in a function defined elsewhere or in an IIFE.
2014-11-07 21:10:45	wormmd	All of that is besides the point though.
