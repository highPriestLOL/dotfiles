2014-08-28 18:21:47	Alittlemurkling	Hello Arch. I finally switched back to slim, now that it works with systemd. However, I'm having an issue where slim discards the X session when I switch to a tty. Xorg.0.log reports: 'systemd-logind: failed to get session: PID 6769 does not belong to any known session', but I think that may have to do with the new rootless behavior of the xorg-server. Any thoughts?

2014-08-28 18:22:09	Alittlemurkling	Oh, and slim.log doesn't contain anything abnormal.
2014-08-28 18:22:12	Namarrgon	slim was fixed?
2014-08-28 18:22:22	Alittlemurkling	Sort of.
2014-08-28 18:22:44	Alittlemurkling	It will log you in at lease.
2014-08-28 18:22:49	Namarrgon	then it is still broken
2014-08-28 18:22:52	alad	display managers are not compatible to rootless X
2014-08-28 18:22:56	alad	use xinit or run X as root

2014-08-28 18:23:11	Morley	Anyone else been having issues VLC crashing on wmv files due to ffmpeg? Had it downgraded to 1:2.2.4-3 for about 2 months and it's still not fixed.
