2014-08-25 22:10:50	RhodiumToad	the actual statement that caused the FK constraint failure will be in the server logs.
2014-08-25 22:10:55	wolftune	I suspect the problem had to do with how I first tried to do the change
2014-08-25 22:10:56	RhodiumToad	why not find it and take a look?
2014-08-25 22:11:02	wolftune	I first migrated by doing "ALTER TABLE "comment" ADD CONSTRAINT "comment_approved_user_fkey" FOREIGN KEY("approved_by") REFERENCES "user"("id");"
2014-08-25 22:11:10	wolftune	when I had problems
2014-08-25 22:11:33	wolftune	like after I first renamed, that seemed to work, but then there were missing constraints so I added that
2014-08-25 22:11:40	wolftune	and that's when I got the error later
2014-08-25 22:12:02	wolftune	I think I'm just in over my head here.
2014-08-25 22:12:11	wolftune	I thought the rename would be simple

2014-08-26 17:52:52	xapiens_	thanks
2014-08-26 17:53:13	nemo	macdice and davidfetter_ebay, since you'd expressed a mild interest.  Since the existence of that trigger was always causing oracle to update the first clob in the update and the clob that was subject to the after insert/update trigger...
2014-08-26 17:53:35	nemo	I just moved the clob that was subject to the trigger to separate update, and added a long comment
2014-08-26 17:53:41	nemo	that fixes, and I still hate oracle
2014-08-26 17:53:43	davidfetter_ebay	nemo, so not the jdbc thing?
2014-08-26 17:53:58	nemo	davidfetter_ebay: well. wasn't the thing he linked to, since that one was only 4K+ clobs.
2014-08-26 17:54:23	davidfetter_ebay	ah
2014-08-26 17:54:26	nemo	this happens to varying forms of 1K or so strings, but entirely dependent on string contents, which is definitely WTF
2014-08-26 17:54:59	nemo	that is, very short strings don't do it, some longer strings do, but fiddling with whitespace in them makes it stop happening, and has nothing to do with unicode which was one wild-ass theory as to what the magic in the strings was
2014-08-26 17:55:07	nemo	I hex-dumped and the strings  were all 7bit ascii

2014-08-26 18:19:49	davidfetter_ebay	automagic fails with "irreversible" (data-losing) steps
