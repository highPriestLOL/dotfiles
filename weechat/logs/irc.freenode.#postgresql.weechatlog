2014-08-25 22:10:55	wolftune	I suspect the problem had to do with how I first tried to do the change
2014-08-25 22:10:56	RhodiumToad	why not find it and take a look?
2014-08-25 22:11:02	wolftune	I first migrated by doing "ALTER TABLE "comment" ADD CONSTRAINT "comment_approved_user_fkey" FOREIGN KEY("approved_by") REFERENCES "user"("id");"
2014-08-25 22:11:10	wolftune	when I had problems
2014-08-25 22:11:33	wolftune	like after I first renamed, that seemed to work, but then there were missing constraints so I added that
2014-08-25 22:11:40	wolftune	and that's when I got the error later
2014-08-25 22:12:02	wolftune	I think I'm just in over my head here.
2014-08-25 22:12:11	wolftune	I thought the rename would be simple

2014-08-26 17:52:52	xapiens_	thanks
2014-08-26 17:53:13	nemo	macdice and davidfetter_ebay, since you'd expressed a mild interest.  Since the existence of that trigger was always causing oracle to update the first clob in the update and the clob that was subject to the after insert/update trigger...
2014-08-26 17:53:35	nemo	I just moved the clob that was subject to the trigger to separate update, and added a long comment
2014-08-26 17:53:41	nemo	that fixes, and I still hate oracle
2014-08-26 17:53:43	davidfetter_ebay	nemo, so not the jdbc thing?
2014-08-26 17:53:58	nemo	davidfetter_ebay: well. wasn't the thing he linked to, since that one was only 4K+ clobs.
2014-08-26 17:54:23	davidfetter_ebay	ah
2014-08-26 17:54:26	nemo	this happens to varying forms of 1K or so strings, but entirely dependent on string contents, which is definitely WTF
2014-08-26 17:54:59	nemo	that is, very short strings don't do it, some longer strings do, but fiddling with whitespace in them makes it stop happening, and has nothing to do with unicode which was one wild-ass theory as to what the magic in the strings was
2014-08-26 17:55:07	nemo	I hex-dumped and the strings  were all 7bit ascii

2014-08-31 11:44:24	vaibhav	I have understood how I can set things up. Indexes, querying mechanisms (though not completely) and so on.
2014-08-31 11:44:44	vaibhav	So let me read the docs and if there is anything, I'd come back.
2014-08-31 11:44:51	vaibhav	@digitalknight thanks again for the link .
2014-08-31 11:46:58	mst	vaibhav: this is IRC. stop putting @ in front of people's names.
2014-08-31 11:47:02	mst	it's really confusing

2014-08-31 11:50:57	vaibhav	Apologies.
2014-08-31 11:51:27	mst	it's cool. but 'name:' is normal in IRC, tends to be better supported by clients
2014-08-31 11:51:34	vaibhav	the 'at' symbol got it working...so. Sorry anyways. I'd be off from here now.

2014-09-01 08:55:46	codehotter	how do I create a readonly user that will have readonly privileges even if new tables/etc are created?
2014-09-01 08:56:01	RhodiumToad	codehotter: alter default privileges only affects objects created by the stated user
2014-09-01 08:56:23	RhodiumToad	codehotter: there is no way to create a global readonly user that's independent of individual table grants
2014-09-01 08:56:34	codehotter	RhodiumToad: so I could give it the application user and then it would affect objects created by the application? That would work then, right?

2014-09-01 10:27:31	RhodiumToad	on the master, the number of connections also governs the number of in-progress top-level transactions

2014-09-01 13:20:52	peerce	if your server has N cores/threads, I find doing much over 2N actual concurrent transactions will slow it down, so ideally your pooler serializes queries to limit them to a sane number.   that only works effectively for small OLTP type operations, however.
2014-09-01 13:21:59	peerce	let me explain that bettter.   say you need to do 1000 transactions, but you only have 24 hardware threads (2 6C xeons with hyperthreading...).  if you do those 1000 48 at a time, vs trying to do all 1000 at once, doing 48 at a time will actually take less time overall.

I've got Fabric script to run a dev harness and it has a reset_db() function which should be issuing a TRUNCATE, but it doesn't appear to be, because we later get integrity errors due to test data clashing with data from a previous test that should have been dropped with TRUNCATE

2014-09-09 14:23:39	dzhus	ok, I have a problem with FKs + serializable transactions again. So in my transaction I insert into table A which refers to B. B is concurrently updated. Transaction fails with "could not serialize access due to concurrent update"

2014-09-09 14:31:23	peerce	mdel; you can't use a SELECT expression in a WHERE clause, because WHERE Is run BEFORE selecting rows.
2014-09-09 14:32:23	peerce	you could, I suppose say WHERE (landuse is not null and leisure is not null and ....)   as your coalesce would only be null if ALL those fields were null.

2014-09-11 20:20:51	lluad	alexlatchford: Exactly that. The second time you run the query postgresql does all the same things - but a lot of the data it needs is already cached in RAM (both by postgresql and by the OS filesystem cache) rather than having to be read sloooooowly from disk.

2014-09-11 20:21:17	alexlatchford	is there a way I can eagerly load that?
2014-09-11 20:21:53	lluad	There are a few ways, if your database is significantly smaller than RAM, anyway.

2014-09-11 20:22:24	lluad	Just running the query is one. You can play with physically reading the disk files (dd if=/whatever of=/dev/null) just to warm the filesystem cache.
2014-09-11 20:22:24	alexlatchford	hmm, it's not that's what I figured. This might need a rethink
2014-09-11 20:23:46	lluad	Generally, though, you try and tune your queries for what they'll look like in production. So you assume that it's been running for a while and "hot" bits of the database, like index roots, are in RAM.

2014-09-11 20:25:40	lluad	sfx: Schemas are great for modular bits of code, like database plugins. PostGIS, for instance, stashes a lot of things it does in it's own schema so they're not in your way.
2014-09-11 20:26:29	lluad	sfx: They're also good if you've got several apps all using the database - a wiki, a web forum, a bug trackers, say - that weren't designed to work together. But you want them in the same database (so they can share a user table, say).
2014-09-11 20:26:54	lluad	You can give each app it's own schema, set the search path for each app to point to it's schema, and know they won't stomp on each others toes.

2014-09-13 14:51:39	sehrope__	Multiple schemas can be a serious headache, especially to rollout changes. On the one hand it allows you to roll out changes selectively (i.e. a subset of the customers) but it also means you'll need to do 1K DB migrations. Ditto for maintaining multiple versions of your app-code to deal with possibly different schemas.

Stick to a single schema multi-tenant design.

You put the actual tables in a private schema, then connect to the database with a client-specific username, and only give that username access to the updatable views, which are all defined as something like "select * from my_table where client_id = current_user"

2014-09-13 15:12:34	RhodiumToad	however, whether  WHERE intcol > $1   works depends on whether the client interface passing the parameter declares it as unknown (which will work), integer (which will work), or text (which will not work)

2014-09-13 16:07:59	rauco	for instance, create table cars_users (car_id integer, user_id integer, owner boolean); create unique index car_unique_owner on cars_users (car_id) where owner;
2014-09-13 16:08:34	RhodiumToad	what do you want to update?
2014-09-13 16:08:39	mark_t	rauco, normally it's not necessary to worry about it, just update the table any way that you prefer. However, if you're asking because it's a really large table and you want the update to proceed very quickly, it might be slightly faster to drop the index, truncate the table, populate with COPY, then recreate the index. But use only when necessary.
2014-09-13 16:09:15	RhodiumToad	hm, a unique index can't be deferrable, I guess, whereas a unique constraint can
2014-09-13 16:09:19	rauco	I want to update the owner, ie. change user_id owner for a given car_id
2014-09-13 16:09:49	RhodiumToad	update the old owner row to false and then the new owner row to true, in two update statements in the same transaction
2014-09-13 16:10:38	rauco	right

2014-09-13 19:39:32	RhodiumToad	you can get either a zeroth-order or a first-order estimate of the number of rows in a table from pg_class, but it's still only an estimate

2014-09-13 21:03:46	sehrope__	Using LIMIT/OFFSET (for example for paging search results) is slow when you have a large number of results (say 10s of 1000s) and the user clicks to page 999. The query executor would need to fetch, sort, and skip, a large number of rows to get to your results.
2014-09-13 21:04:33	sehrope__	If you're not going to have more than 500 rows I doubt you'll notice perf issues ... at that size it should be entirely in memory

2014-09-13 21:27:31	UnNaturalHigh	Can anyone here speak to the speed at which postgresql can consume data? I have just been doing some quick tests today with stocks with Postgresql and Mongodb and I'm worried that Postgresql may not be able to ingest data from some SCADA systems fast enough. Can anyone comment?

2014-09-14 15:44:55	sgiLami	I was just wondering if I could use Schema:: to create that type in my migrations
2014-09-14 15:44:56	RhodiumToad	i.e.  select ... group by ... having ...
2014-09-14 15:45:12	reekick	Oh alright, thanks for that
2014-09-14 15:45:30	reekick	But where works too, right?
2014-09-14 15:45:32	RhodiumToad	reekick: the final component is to find the overall average, which you should also be able to do
2014-09-14 15:45:47	RhodiumToad	reekick: WHERE is evaluated BEFORE grouping, whereas HAVING is evaluated AFTER
2014-09-14 15:46:24	RhodiumToad	reekick: or you can add a nesting level and do   select * from (select ... group by ...) AS s where ...;   but for simple conditions that's not necessary and is harder to read
2014-09-14 15:47:13	reekick	Ah, I see. So how do I go about finding the two different averages? Pardon me, I suck at this :|

2014-09-14 19:14:11	relgar	great, don't mind me then... So I'm using PG to convert a dump of JSON data into a star schema.  Through trial and error, I've figured out flattening out the fields and indexing the resultant columns results in faster query response.   But the JSON docs are somewhat hetereogeneous, so there are about 20 distinct fields, leaving to a very wide/sparse fact table.
2014-09-14 19:15:15	relgar	The trouble I'm having is that to ETL even say 5 million JSON docs takes about 1-2 hours, counting all the index creation, and esp. linking fk cols on the fact table to the dimension tables
2014-09-14 19:15:42	relgar	I'm fairly new to data warehousing, so let me know if what I've described/done so far doesn't make sense...

2014-09-14 19:17:17	relgar	I end up gonig through the fact table like 20 times, once for each fk column/dimension table.... I was thinking I could speed it up by doing it in chunks of rows and applying multiple connections to do parallel UPDATEs... Was hoping that doing in bite sized chunks would be faster, since everything could be done in memory.

2014-09-14 19:18:57	relgar	Similarly, for queries, I noticed that for index-only scans, if the entire index fits into the memory of the query procses, then it's quite fast (naturally).  However, indices can be 3-4GB for a 10 million row table... I'm not sure what can be done to try to optimize if I don't want to allow each query to use 5+GB memory... table partitioning?

2014-09-15 18:08:20	RhodiumToad	zhodge: both the check constraint method and the enum method should be limited to cases when adding new allowed values is logically equivalent to DDL, i.e. it's part of a schema upgrade or whatever

2014-09-15 18:09:10	zhodge	RhodiumToad: got it; so should I consider the check constraint and enum options to be nearly equivalent?
2014-09-15 18:10:10	RhodiumToad	zhodge: the main drawback to enums is that adding a new enum value can't be done inside a transaction (it's one of only a double handful of SQL commands in that category)
2014-09-15 18:10:42	RhodiumToad	zhodge: updating a check constraint can, though as expected for DDL it means locks and a table scan
2014-09-15 18:11:05	RhodiumToad	zhodge: on the other hand, enums are somewhat more efficient

2014-09-15 19:15:49	sehrope__	Cow_woC: You can use the value of the sequence in a two-byte column
2014-09-15 19:16:46	Cow_woC	sehrope__: I see. Okay, I'm trying to define auto-incremented primary keys, but use up the entire range (start at the negative minimum and increment by one)
2014-09-15 19:16:55	Cow_woC	sehrope__: Is there anything I should know when doing that?
2014-09-15 19:17:06	sehrope__	If it's for a one-off check out generate_series()
2014-09-15 19:17:29	sehrope__	It's much easier to use. Ex: SELECT x FROM generate_series(1, 100) x

2014-09-15 19:23:47	Cow_woC	sehrope__: I saw that, thanks. Is it possible to make CREATE SEQUENCE works the same way as SERIAL in that when I insert a new row into the table, it automatically uses the next sequence value?
2014-09-15 19:24:06	Cow_woC	sehrope__: I mean, if I create a sequence manually, how do I tell the other table to use it for inserts?
2014-09-15 19:24:12	sehrope__	SERIAL creates a sequence behind the scenes and sets it to be the default value for the column.
2014-09-15 19:24:29	sehrope__	You can either use it directly via nextval('my_sequence') or set it as the default for the column.
2014-09-15 19:24:45	Cow_woC	sehrope__: Is there a way to set the MINVALUE of SERIAL and friends?

2014-09-20 14:55:55	peerce	the more typical model for distributed application development is to have the remote clients talk to an app server via https w/ soap or corba or whatever, then have the remote clients talk to that app server.   the app server implements all the business logic and is the only thing allowed to talk SQL to the database.

2014-09-20 15:10:25	MatheusOl	Right?
2014-09-20 15:10:25	RhodiumToad	peerce: when you add an attribute to the definition, that's then > natts for any existing value, and hence shows up as null
2014-09-20 15:10:25	MatheusOl	So, you can simple add an attribute to "foo" type, and it is done, "colx" will see that as NULL for old rows

2014-09-20 19:54:54	akurilin	How frequently does PG check that a log file is over a certain size?
2014-09-20 19:55:54	johto	a log file? why would it check a log file's size?
2014-09-20 19:56:04	xocolatl	because it does
2014-09-20 19:56:10	akurilin	log_rotation_size
2014-09-20 19:56:34	xocolatl	probably every time it writes, but I'd have to look at the code
2014-09-20 19:56:53	akurilin	I've seen cases where I'll set a 1gb limit and it will go over no problem
2014-09-20 19:57:02	akurilin	I'm not sure what the underlying logic for that is
2014-09-20 19:57:05	xocolatl	by how much?
2014-09-20 19:57:37	johto	"After this many kilobytes have been emitted into a log file, a new log file will be created." <-- I'm not sure why it would need to check a file's size to conform to that spec
2014-09-20 19:58:02	akurilin	xocolatl: I remember seeing 1gb limit and the file being at about 1.2

2014-09-20 19:58:12	akurilin	it's a bit anecdotal unfortunately
2014-09-20 19:58:25	akurilin	I'd love to be able to say have... up to 50 gzipped log files max in the log folder
2014-09-20 19:58:38	akurilin	not sure how I would make that happen though without being very clever about the date format

2014-09-20 20:00:59	akurilin	xocolatl: asks for the current size?

2014-09-21 11:49:16	MatheusOl	Ah... I think the answer is "no"
2014-09-21 11:49:17	johto	the session mode just queues them up waiting for a connection
2014-09-21 11:49:20	MatheusOl	If I got the question
2014-09-21 11:49:45	johto	so it can help in cases where something just connects, runs a txn or three and then disconnects
2014-09-21 11:49:49	MatheusOl	bougyman: Although it can reuse a connection after a client ends, it gives the same to another client
2014-09-21 11:52:07	bougyman	so it doesn't help for constant connections.

2014-09-21 11:53:10	bougyman	we have a bunch of workers that listen to kafka topics and write to pg.
2014-09-21 11:53:18	bougyman	they keep a connection open constantly.

2014-09-21 11:53:52	bougyman	would transaction pooling help?

What I know for sure is the problem tables are heavily updated, there are no long-running transactions, and vacuum full reclaims a ton of space, but the DB wil grow until it runs out of disk if that's not done.  Adjusting autovacuum settings affects how often it runs, but appears to have minimal effect on

2014-09-22 20:47:03	MatheusOl	cmullican: One problem of changing fillfactor, is that you don't see an immediate result
2014-09-22 20:47:12	in_deep_thought	its a numeric array of unts so liek [!u 32, !u 122 …. etc] 16 of them. which Im converting to a hex string, then I want to later be able to look at that hex string
2014-09-22 20:47:14	RhodiumToad	bear in mind that changing it only really kicks in after a vacuum full or otherwise complete rewrite of the table
2014-09-22 20:47:16	MatheusOl	cmullican: Unless you rewrite the table (with VACUUM FULL, for instance)
2014-09-22 20:47:22	in_deep_thought	and convert it back to the numeric array

2014-09-22 20:48:45	RhodiumToad	int[] expects input like '{1,4,10,2}'  and produces output similar

2014-09-22 20:49:29	RhodiumToad	cmullican: the idea is to do a vacuum full as a once-off after changing the fillfactor, and then see what effect it has on normal operations without vacuum full
2014-09-22 20:49:31	in_deep_thought	peerce: 8

2014-09-22 20:50:06	RhodiumToad	right, smallint is 16 bit

2014-09-22 20:58:08	RhodiumToad	if you get stable results at 50, then let it run for a while and use pgstattuple to measure the actual space usage

2014-09-22 21:35:31	RhodiumToad	so there are tab separators, but no other processing, implying that tabs and newlines can never appear in the data?
2014-09-22 21:35:48	adoniscik	correct, slashes are the worst it gets
2014-09-22 21:36:27	RhodiumToad	right, but COPY text mode doesn't have an option to not process \

2014-09-28 22:34:37	RhodiumToad	ningu: in particular, stable or immutable functions don't have any sort of cache that prevents them being called multiple times

2014-09-28 22:37:02	ningu	well, I think I mostly know what's immutable at this point and there are only a few functions in that category. but there are many where volatile vs. stable is an open question that the author of the function has not considered.
2014-09-28 22:37:10	RhodiumToad	ningu: if a function is stable, then it can participate in index scan clauses, e.g. WHERE indexedcol = stablefunc(...)
2014-09-28 22:37:42	RhodiumToad	ningu: also, a stable function runs in the (read-only) snapshot of its caller, which sometimes speeds things up a little
2014-09-28 22:38:40	RhodiumToad	ningu: a stable function is sometimes called during planning (as an _extra_ call to execution) in order to obtain an estimated result for planning purposes

2014-10-01 19:30:19	skaufman_	i've got an alter column where i'm changing a character varying to a text, i put a local timeout just in case it isnt instant
2014-10-01 19:30:33	skaufman_	it is always timing out, i think bevcause it is waiting for a lock
2014-10-01 19:30:48	xocolatl	what is the point of that change?  the types are the same
2014-10-01 19:31:04	skaufman_	because the character varing has length 7
2014-10-01 19:31:17	skaufman_	and i need more than seven chars
2014-10-01 19:31:24	xocolatl	and you can set lock_timeout instead of statement_timeout
2014-10-01 19:31:55	xocolatl	if you change it from character varying(7) to character varying, you won't have to rewrite the table

2014-10-01 19:37:48	skaufman_	xocolatl: yeah, i put a  statement timeout in case the alter ends up taking more than zero time

2014-10-01 19:38:14	skaufman_	i mean, i set it to 5s
2014-10-01 19:38:20	skaufman_	its not set to zero
2014-10-01 19:38:25	skaufman_	form what i've been told it should be instant
2014-10-01 19:38:32	skaufman_	because the underlying type is th esame
2014-10-01 19:38:49	xocolatl	they're not the same types, one is constrained
2014-10-01 19:38:57	skaufman_	but to be safe, the timeout would prevent locking the table until i can kill the procrss from inside pg
2014-10-01 19:39:02	xocolatl	but going this direction is pretty much instant
2014-10-01 19:39:15	skaufman_	wyeah thats what i've been told

2014-10-03 11:09:39	ianp	so I can do it transparently on the server side for selects and inserts/updates
2014-10-03 11:09:50	ianp	then the applications just read and write to a single table?
2014-10-03 11:10:07	ianp	that's how I'd prefer to design the application
2014-10-03 11:10:25	ianp	the developers now are talking about automating table creation and indexing and stuff from the app point of view - seems messy
2014-10-03 11:11:38	Snow-Man	breinbaas: yea, not likely..
2014-10-03 11:12:01	Snow-Man	ianp: well, the inserts/updates require that you set up a trigger on the parent to move the new data into the right partition.

2014-10-03 11:12:21	Snow-Man	ianp: but, yes, once you've done that server-side, the application can just work with the one table.
2014-10-03 11:12:40	Snow-Man	ianp: better to have that kind of stuff handled on the database-server side..
2014-10-03 11:12:48	ianp	yes

2014-10-03 11:48:59	MatheusOl	cr3: Ok. postmaster.pid should exist on PGDATA, no mather what external_pid_file says
2014-10-03 11:49:17	MatheusOl	cr3: external_pid_file is an extra file created, not the one really used by PostgreSQL
2014-10-03 11:49:30	MatheusOl	cr3: So, someone removed that file, I can't say how
2014-10-03 11:49:30	ildefonso	MatheusOl, just as an academic exercise, why would that query timeout? are the views locked at some points?
2014-10-03 11:49:53	MatheusOl	ildefonso: Locked? I don't think so. But it does more job than needed
2014-10-03 11:50:07	MatheusOl	ildefonso: Depending how many relations and databases you have, it may take sometime
2014-10-03 11:50:39	ildefonso	it is usually instantaneous, just as the other one... now, both of them timeout on a particular server, that is suffering from deadlocks.
2014-10-03 11:50:48	cr3	MatheusOl: I suspect I know why, that's an excellent lead :)
2014-10-03 11:50:52	MatheusOl	ildefonso: If you do a simple `SELECT sum(idx_scan) FROM pg_stat_user_indexes` on the same database, does it timeout?
2014-10-03 11:51:20	MatheusOl	cr3: It is safe to kill the postmaster, but not with -9, a regular kill
2014-10-03 11:51:33	MatheusOl	SITTERM, IIRC
2014-10-03 11:51:33	cr3	MatheusOl: also, I recently wrote a Python daemon and my pid related error messages didn't contain the path to the pid file in case of error; I just added it because it would've been useful for postgresql too :)

2014-10-03 12:37:46	EthPyth	No PostgreSQL clusters exist; see "man pg_createcluster"

2014-10-03 14:11:46	MatheusOl	patarr: The conclusion is that you shouldn't use abbreviation
2014-10-03 14:12:10	MatheusOl	e.g. CST can be America/Costa_Rica, America/Guatemala, Australia/South, ...
2014-10-03 14:12:16	MatheusOl	pick one (the correct one, of course)

2014-10-11 15:41:44	peerce	a basebackup is something you explicitly make yourself
2014-10-11 15:42:14	peerce	it can be a straight copy of the $PGDATA directory, or it can be a tar.gz or most any other folder archive format.
2014-10-11 15:42:53	peerce	to recover with a wal archive, you start from the basebackup, then playback all WAL files since that backup was started.

2014-10-11 16:27:43	matjaz	hey guys, I have a little question. How do I change the owner of a cluster? Curentlly, the owner of my main cluster is unknown, which is not good.
2014-10-11 16:28:12	dim	so you want to rename him "who", right?
2014-10-11 16:30:37	matjaz	dim: I'm not sure I understand your question. :)
2014-10-11 16:30:46	dim	it's a joke
2014-10-11 16:30:54	dim	who's in first base, etc
2014-10-11 16:31:19	matjaz	Oh, the baseball joke
2014-10-11 16:31:21	matjaz	:D
2014-10-11 16:32:49	dim	yeah, would be fine with "who's the owner for that cluster?"
2014-10-11 16:34:39	matjaz	"sudo pg_lsclusters" gives me this

2014-10-13 12:46:26	MatheusOl	IMO, skaag should use JOIN syntax. That would help avoiding such confusions
2014-10-13 12:46:28	RhodiumToad	the way that pg implements CTEs means they are essentially always slower than an inline subquery unless either the result is being referenced more than once, or the CTE is being used to constrain the join order to produce a better plan than the planner can manage by itself

2014-10-13 12:56:10	RhodiumToad	the fact that quals can't be pushed into a CTE, and that a CTE can't be used as a parameterized plan subtree, are probably the major restrictions impacting performance

2014-10-13 13:45:37	JohanW_Home	Hi. I could use some psychic debugging help. I have a created a view. When I simply execute the query that the view consists of it takes 2,5 seconds. Same if I simply grab all rows from the view. But if I add a conditional on one of the columns (which is a COUNT in the view definition) it suddenly takes two minutes.
2014-10-13 13:46:02	JohanW_Home	Is this a normal behaviour for aggregate columns, or have I messed something up?

2014-10-13 15:52:49	JohanW_Home	One weird thing about the original problem is that a previous version of the view - which also is using the same function - is NOT slow when using WHERE.

2014-10-13 15:54:59	RhodiumToad	did the previous version of the view have an order by clause or an offset clause?

2014-10-13 15:55:53	bhenderson	I have postgres installed in one dir and extensions through yum installed in another dir (very new to this)
2014-10-13 15:56:02	RhodiumToad	that has the same optimization-blocking effect as offset 0

2014-10-13 15:56:32	peerce	bhenderson; each extension is in its own subdirectory under the extensions directory.   what are you trying to do?
2014-10-13 15:57:31	peerce	the rpm versions use like /usr/pgsql-9.3/share/extension
2014-10-13 15:57:54	MatheusOl	JohanW_Home: Simpler (and possible not proper/best) solution is to add OFFSET 0 to the view
2014-10-13 15:58:20	bhenderson	RhodiumToad: my work uses a custom package manager that mixes home grown with yum
2014-10-13 15:58:28	peerce	bhenderson; eeew, why??

2014-10-13 15:58:48	peerce	so where's postgres itself installed ?
2014-10-13 15:58:56	peerce	they compiled their own postgresql server?

2014-10-13 16:00:26	peerce	the rpm version would only possibly work if your PG build uses exactly the same options as the rpm build.
2014-10-13 16:00:30	ningu	I can't remember what it's called... that makes it very easy to build extensions like that
2014-10-13 16:00:37	peerce	pgxs or something

2014-10-13 19:44:17	MatheusOl	ningu: The docs means when there is no input, in your case there is one, that happens to be NULL
2014-10-13 19:44:26	ningu	"array_agg returns null rather than an empty array when there are no input rows. The coalesce function can be used to substitute zero or an empty array for null when necessary."

2014-10-13 19:45:02	johto	would work for both cases with that
2014-10-13 19:45:38	MatheusOl	On 9.4 we could do COALESCE(array_agg(lvsc.sc) FILTER(lvsc.sc IS NOT NULL), '{}')

I have table Y (id int primary key) and table X (id int primary key, Y_id int, updated_at timestamp).  there could be many rows in X with the same Y_id.  I have queries that need to find the most recent row with a particular Y_id.  What's likely to be my best index to make those queries performant?  Essentially I'm wondering if a combined index on (updated_at, Y_id) would be

2014-10-14 19:56:21	darkblue_b	ok - so I am not a complete fool
2014-10-14 19:56:55	danlovesproofs	If I partition a table and add a constraint, let's say CHECK (col != 'foo'), on one of the child tables, postgres will use that constraint and skip the subquery if I run a query with "WHERE col = 'foo'".
2014-10-14 19:57:23	darkblue_b	yes
2014-10-14 19:57:36	danlovesproofs	But it looks like, on a regular vanilla table, if I create a constraint like that and then run "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE col = foo", it will run a full table scan, i.e. won't use the constraint.
2014-10-14 19:57:41	danlovesproofs	What are the semantics here?
2014-10-14 19:58:07	MatheusOl	danlovesproofs: constraint_exclusion isn't checked in such case
2014-10-14 19:58:09	danlovesproofs	I.e., where are constraints used? Is there active work to make them useful in more places, or is this mostly an academic concern?

2014-10-14 20:00:00	danlovesproofs	Another one I've noticed is that, if I create a constraint a la CHECK (A AND B AND C), and then I want to break this up into three constraints: CHECK (A), CHECK (B), and CHECK (C), it does the full table scan / validation for each one, whereas you can guarantee from the first constraint that none of these is violated.

2014-10-14 20:01:29	johto	danlovesproofs; the case you talked about earlier depends on the setting constraint_exclusion. by default it excludes "vanilla" tables like you found, to increase planning speed
2014-10-14 20:01:59	johto	I think adding a CHECK constraint always does a full table scan, though
2014-10-14 20:02:16	darkblue_b	there is one more package for b3 to install, but it complains about "dumping a b2 database"  but I have done so already

2014-10-24 16:00:00	wad	So upon installing postgres, I think that there is a database named "postgres". Is it Best Practice for my application to just its schemas and data into that database, or to make a new one, named for the application?

2014-10-24 16:03:12	revoohc	RhodiumToad:  Then what is the proper way to show a timestamptz in a different time zone w/o losing the time zone?

2014-10-24 16:04:14	RhodiumToad	MatheusOl: that returns a timestamp without time zone. as I just explained.

2014-10-24 16:04:53	RhodiumToad	revoohc: so what you want is the timestamp in some other time zone, plus the UTC offset that would be in effect for that time zone at that time?
2014-10-24 16:04:59	revoohc	Matheus, we’d really like to convert timestamp from EST/EDT to UTC when we return them from the DB, however, we want to keep the timestamp so the app knows what it is receiving.

2014-10-24 16:21:55	davidfetter	i am far from sure that that's the correct reaction, now that VIEWs are writeable by default
2014-10-24 16:22:04	riceandbeans	hey davidfetter, how's everything going?
2014-10-24 16:22:16	davidfetter	riceandbeans, hectic, but the good kind
2014-10-24 16:22:20	wad	Okay, question: So I'll soon switch our application to store its data in a database other than "postgres". I'll drop all of our applications tables in that database. Is there more that I should to to clean it up?
2014-10-24 16:23:14	davidfetter	digicon, if pg_dump isn't fast enough, you should definitely be getting off RDS

2014-10-24 16:23:45	RhodiumToad	wad: shouldn't need to. The "postgres" database only exists as a default place to connect to for administrative commands
2014-10-24 16:23:53	davidfetter	RhodiumToad, so i'm extending the file_fdw to support IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA
2014-10-24 16:23:56	wad	Okay, that's good to know. Thanks!

2014-10-24 16:25:07	davidfetter	oh :(
2014-10-24 16:25:27	davidfetter	so there's no inference machinery i can pick up and use? :/

2014-10-24 20:07:42	asido	grayhemp, I understand. that's why I consider sharding. your idea with statistics table isn't very clear to me. do you think it would be effective in my case and would allow to avoid all the complexity which comes with sharding?

2014-10-27 21:03:36	ildefonso	darkblue_b, the reason why b-tree indexes are used for pattern matching when anchored at the beginning is due to the way b-trees work.

2014-10-27 21:03:53	ildefonso	darkblue_b, by adding .* after the beginning it will no longer be able to use the index at all.

2014-10-27 22:11:25	RhodiumToad	jumps of about that size in sequence values usually mean that pg crashed or was shut down uncleanly
2014-10-27 22:11:35	rkgarcia	RhodiumToad, because i need id's with sequential values
2014-10-27 22:11:45	RhodiumToad	there are no values missing, but the sequence is advanced during recovery
2014-10-27 22:12:19	RhodiumToad	if you need sequential values then sequences are no good to you, because all they guarantee is increasing values (barring use of CYCLE or setval)

2014-10-27 22:24:31	RhodiumToad	for example, if you assign an id to a row and roll back the insert, then a contiguous assignment of ids would mean assigning the same id to the next insert - so you'd need to be damn sure you never exposed the id anywhere the first time, where it might be confused for the second row

2014-10-27 22:26:30	mperry__	i'm trying to move a ton of data out to a set of other tables, by right(col, 2) of a given column.  what's the fastest way to do that?  i'm currently doing multiple concurrent "with Q as (delete ... returning *) insert into ..." one table at a time
2014-10-27 22:27:15	RhodiumToad	hm, tricky
2014-10-27 22:27:34	RhodiumToad	is the delete necessary?
2014-10-27 22:27:59	mperry__	sort of, i can delete on an inner join afterwards if it's faster to do so in two operations
2014-10-27 22:28:21	RhodiumToad	probably not
2014-10-27 22:28:37	mperry__	the biggest question i had right off the bat, was is it faster to do multiple concurrent deletes from the same table insertiing into random tables, or one delete per table with multiple concurrent inserts on the target?

2014-10-31 19:44:28	chrchr	Well, it depends on the size and shape of the records, for one thing.
2014-10-31 19:44:36	owen1	and than you can say stuff like "in 2 years, assuming growth x, we'll need to figure out how to scale the db into another node"
2014-10-31 19:44:40	chrchr	And how much memory and how fast are the disks and how many CPUs and all of that stuff.
2014-10-31 19:46:20	owen1	are there existing projects that share those numbers? what's their hardware setup, records structure and how many postgres hosts can handle that?

2014-10-31 20:47:46	RhodiumToad	usually the best starting point for finding performance issues in a query is to do an EXPLAIN ANALYZE, and paste the result into explain.depesz.com which will provide some useful highlighting

2014-11-02 19:08:40	fortuneHuntr	how can i make postgres only listen on localhost?
2014-11-02 19:08:54	peerce	listen_address = 'localhost'  in postgresql.conf
2014-11-02 19:08:56	xocolatl	fortuneHuntr: set  listen_addresses = 'localhost'  in your postgresql.conf
2014-11-02 19:09:03	fortuneHuntr	it is exactly that
2014-11-02 19:09:07	peerce	er, yeah, addresses
2014-11-02 19:09:09	fortuneHuntr	and still not
2014-11-02 19:09:14	xocolatl	did you restart?
2014-11-02 19:09:19	fortuneHuntr	yes
2014-11-02 19:09:21	peerce	have you restarted postgres?   reload isn't sufficient
2014-11-02 19:09:27	fortuneHuntr	unless i misunderstand what netstat is saying
2014-11-02 19:09:29	fortuneHuntr	yes
2014-11-02 19:09:33	fortuneHuntr	even rebooted
2014-11-02 19:09:44	peerce	pastebin what netstat says
2014-11-02 19:09:47	fortuneHuntr	netstat -antp shows 1.2.3.4:5432 (where 1.2.3.4 is my ip)
2014-11-02 19:10:01	StuckMojo	mikeshultz: i think in that case it would be kosher to update it by hand
2014-11-02 19:10:11	peerce	then you didn't edit the correct postgresql.conf or something.
2014-11-02 19:10:20	StuckMojo	mikeshultz: but it's only logic and gut feeling telling me that
2014-11-02 19:10:30	peerce	what do you get in SQL from SHOW LISTEN_ADDRESSES;    ?
2014-11-02 19:10:30	fortuneHuntr	first of all, i just installed and didn't change any configs
2014-11-02 19:10:37	StuckMojo	mikeshultz: there is a #slony you can ask in, although it might take a bit to get an answer
2014-11-02 19:11:44	StuckMojo	fortuneHuntr: is listen_addresses uncommented?
2014-11-02 19:11:46	peerce	oh.  whats in /etc/hosts on the localhost lines ?

2014-11-02 19:12:21	fortuneHuntr	for some reason, I'm having issues SSH-ing to the box - one sec
2014-11-02 19:12:23	peerce	some linux systems seem to like to put your IP in as localhost
2014-11-02 19:12:27	StuckMojo	do as peerce suggests and connect to pg and run: show listen_addresses;
2014-11-02 19:12:28	StuckMojo	in sql
2014-11-02 19:12:41	StuckMojo	peerce: ah, good one
2014-11-02 19:13:57	fortuneHuntr	hmm, could it be /etc/hosts?

2014-11-02 19:14:47	StuckMojo	so, you've got a couple options: 1) change that or 2) listen_addresses = '127.0.0.1'
2014-11-02 19:14:51	peerce	some linux installers do that if you supply incomplete network configuration info at the initial install
2014-11-02 19:15:05	peerce	you have 1 option.  CHANGE IT :D
2014-11-02 19:15:09	peerce	2. leads to insanity.
2014-11-02 19:15:09	StuckMojo	lol

2014-11-02 19:15:40	fortuneHuntr	ok, when i reboot, it's being set back
2014-11-02 19:15:59	peerce	wtf ?

2014-11-02 19:18:08	StuckMojo	now that is extremely odd
2014-11-02 19:18:24	StuckMojo	i suggest asking in #debian, as i've run it for 10+ years and never seen such a thing
2014-11-02 19:18:26	peerce	something funky in a /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts file or something?

2014-11-03 21:35:30	RhodiumToad	most of the overhead besides that is in passing those 2m rows through the joins and aggregate
2014-11-03 21:35:56	RhodiumToad	how fast is the query if you run it with \timing in effect rather than using explain analyze?

2014-11-03 21:37:44	RhodiumToad	two gettimeofday calls per row per plan node can add up pretty fast
2014-11-03 21:38:43	chrchr	work_mem=1MB vs. work_mem=512mb is 6220.175 ms vs. 4718.944 ms

2014-11-04 21:32:44	darkblue_b	ok well, considering HTTP is usually public facing, you are exposing your database.. but ok, its sort of interesting

2014-11-07 18:14:29	b0nn	Hi all, I have heard that postgresql has a really useful toolset available when dealing with geolocation data, however when I look on google all i find are on postgis, so, is that what I should be looking at, or is there a better search string for me to put into google
2014-11-07 18:14:40	DiegoMax	b0nn postgis
2014-11-07 18:14:45	DiegoMax	i use that everyday for my daily work
2014-11-07 18:14:55	DiegoMax	and yes, thats what you are looking for
2014-11-07 18:15:00	b0nn	ok

2014-11-07 18:15:33	DiegoMax	if oyu are just starting
2014-11-07 18:15:37	DiegoMax	dont do the same stupid thing i did
2014-11-07 18:15:43	DiegoMax	and install the postgis extension on a separate schema
2014-11-07 18:15:49	DiegoMax	that will make your maintenance work much easier
2014-11-07 18:15:50	b0nn	yes?
2014-11-07 18:15:58	RhodiumToad	partial indexes are always updated just like real indexes
2014-11-07 18:16:08	DiegoMax	yah, if you do backups/restores having postgis on the same schema where you have the data
2014-11-07 18:16:10	DiegoMax	can be a real pain

2014-11-07 18:38:16	RhodiumToad	it's the data that's in question because you are running one build of pg against a data directory created by a previous incompatible build

2014-11-07 18:38:59	RhodiumToad	the fix is to delete your data directory and run initdb again, which of course means losing all the data in it

2014-11-07 18:40:31	RhodiumToad	you potentially have to do this on every build if you track master (it won't actually be needed every time, but often enough and unpredictably)

2014-11-07 19:36:20	DiegoMax_	where "is_finished" IS NOT TRUE

2014-11-07 19:36:36	xocolatl	DiegoMax_: the way NULL is handled
2014-11-07 19:36:37	RhodiumToad	they have different results if is_finished is null
2014-11-07 19:36:43	DiegoMax_	ahhh
2014-11-07 19:36:49	RhodiumToad	NULL IS NOT TRUE  is true, because null is not true
2014-11-07 19:36:58	DiegoMax_	yah makes sence
2014-11-07 19:37:00	DiegoMax_	**sense
2014-11-07 19:37:02	RhodiumToad	NULL = false   is null

2014-11-07 19:37:25	DiegoMax_	i created my partial index with a condition of WHERE "is_finished" IS NOT TRUE
2014-11-07 19:37:30	RhodiumToad	(because NULL = anything is null)
2014-11-07 19:37:36	DiegoMax_	and i just noticed it was not being used unless the query was like that too :D
2014-11-07 19:37:43	DiegoMax_	but yes, it makes sense
2014-11-07 19:37:58	xocolatl	DiegoMax_: select x, x is not true, x = false from unnest(array[true, false, null]) a(x);
2014-11-07 19:38:04	RhodiumToad	it's usually better to use  WHERE NOT is_finished,  or WHERE is_finished = false   (those two are equivalent)

2014-11-07 19:38:37	DiegoMax_	also, another question, is there any command/way to temporarly disable an index witthout deleting it, just to compare performance ?
2014-11-07 19:38:50	RhodiumToad	also it's a good idea to declare boolean columns as NOT NULL unless you're really sure you want to allow nulls
2014-11-07 19:39:02	DiegoMax_	yes the column is not null with default to false
2014-11-07 19:39:12	xocolatl	drop it in a transaction then rollback
2014-11-07 19:39:22	DiegoMax_	xocolatl, good idea, thanks
2014-11-07 19:39:25	RhodiumToad	you can drop the index in a transaction that's rolled back:  BEGIN; DROP INDEX ...; EXPLAIN ANALYZE whatever; ROLLBACK;

2014-11-07 19:47:58	agliodbs	http://pgsql.privatepaste.com/ac2c9bc5d4
2014-11-07 19:48:05	RhodiumToad	depends on exactly what your query conditions are
2014-11-07 19:48:23	lluad	I've been using postgresql as a developer in production for over a decade, DiegoMax_
2014-11-07 19:48:27	DiegoMax_	well let me first say that the query was taking 30ms before, and now its taking 2
2014-11-07 19:48:37	DiegoMax_	so it was not TERRIBLY slow, but now its terribly faster
2014-11-07 19:48:51	lluad	And I don't consider myself a DBA, let alone a "good DBA", "adequate DBA" or even "terrible DBA".
2014-11-07 19:49:04	xocolatl	agliodbs: looking.  first thing that jumps out is the unnecessary CASE statement for locked_tuple
2014-11-07 19:49:16	DiegoMax_	i will paste the query

2014-11-07 19:49:46	agliodbs	oh, yeah, I see your point
2014-11-07 19:49:58	RhodiumToad	it's not distinguishing relation from tuple locks
2014-11-07 19:50:12	DiegoMax_	http://pastie.org/private/dhwxdbbvtfygw2cqdkpw
2014-11-07 19:50:17	agliodbs	RhodiumToad: I didn't plan to.  is there a problem with not separating those two?
2014-11-07 19:50:29	RhodiumToad	well, they can't block each other
2014-11-07 19:50:31	DiegoMax_	thats the query RhodiumToad
2014-11-07 19:50:38	RhodiumToad	so it seems you really ought to distinguish them
2014-11-07 19:51:34	RhodiumToad	DiegoMax_: the "status" column is the one at issue?
2014-11-07 19:51:39	agliodbs	RhodiumToad: yah, that woudl require knowing more about how conflicting tuple locks are represented, though

2014-11-07 19:53:54	DiegoMax_	did i misunderstand ?
2014-11-07 19:54:29	agliodbs	RhodiumToad: I'm more worried that I'm excluding actual locks waiting than having too much input
2014-11-07 19:54:38	RhodiumToad	DiegoMax_: usually, yes; but the issue here is more that there are very few distinct values to index
2014-11-07 19:54:51	DiegoMax_	ok good
2014-11-07 19:55:33	RhodiumToad	so an index on (status) WHERE (status <> 'finished')   will work, it would just be more efficient if it could feasibly be combined with something else
2014-11-07 19:55:42	agliodbs	mostly because I'm hitting a production DB with this and it keeps coming up empty
2014-11-07 19:56:07	RhodiumToad	agliodbs: conflicts on table-level locks should be rare

2014-11-07 20:01:43	DiegoMax_	well its location based, usually you have a few thousand active transactions
2014-11-07 20:01:50	DiegoMax_	and u get the ones close to you
2014-11-07 20:01:52	DiegoMax_	usually 5 or 6
2014-11-07 20:02:03	DiegoMax_	so the answer would be that from a few thousand, you get 5 to 6

2014-11-07 20:55:20	DiegoMax_	yes
2014-11-07 20:55:32	DiegoMax_	every field you see there is from the same table
2014-11-07 20:55:47	RhodiumToad	that's messing up the ability to use a geographic index
2014-11-07 20:55:52	DiegoMax_	oh
2014-11-07 20:56:10	DiegoMax_	let me try the query without that
2014-11-07 20:56:26	DiegoMax_	oh right
2014-11-07 20:56:30	DiegoMax_	no, there is no way i can remove that
2014-11-07 20:56:31	RhodiumToad	what you'd need to do is change the ST_Dwithin
2014-11-07 20:56:42	RhodiumToad	what's the query as it stands now?

2014-11-07 20:57:15	DiegoMax_	thats the query
2014-11-07 20:57:15	RhodiumToad	what I think would work best is if you did
2014-11-07 20:57:38	RhodiumToad	create index ... using gist (_ST_Expand(sa_location, radius_meters)) WHERE ...
2014-11-07 20:57:45	DiegoMax_	wtf...
2014-11-07 20:57:55	RhodiumToad	I think that index would be picked up without changing the query
2014-11-07 20:58:16	DiegoMax_	so the index will contain one entry for every possible value in radius_meters
2014-11-07 20:58:20	DiegoMax_	am i understanding it right ?

2014-11-07 20:58:48	RhodiumToad	for each row, that index will contain not the location as a point, but rather a circle of radius_meters around the point

2014-11-07 21:05:04	RhodiumToad	what I'd expect is that if you have "waiting" rows reasonably distributed geographically, then that should normally be the fastest index
2014-11-07 21:05:42	RhodiumToad	for very small numbers of waiting rows, it'll probably be very little different to other indexes, but if you have more than a few dozen, it should make a difference

2014-11-08 09:12:58	barosl	Oh, it seems that pg_shadow has the very same format with pg_catalog.pg_user
2014-11-08 09:14:01	RhodiumToad	back in the bad old days, pg_user was just a view on pg_shadow that *'d out the password field
2014-11-08 09:14:18	RhodiumToad	pg_shadow is of course superuser-only, whereas pg_user is not
2014-11-08 09:14:50	RhodiumToad	when roles were added, the real table storing the data became pg_authid, and pg_shadow is a view on that for compatibility

2014-11-08 09:15:16	barosl	I see
2014-11-08 09:15:29	RhodiumToad	actually it looks like the view definition for pg_user hasn't changed, it's just that pg_shadow is now a view too
2014-11-08 09:15:45	RhodiumToad	this is from way back, like 8.1 or so
2014-11-08 09:16:23	RhodiumToad	pg_authid has non-login roles as well as login roles

2014-11-08 09:17:00	barosl	Yeah, it should... Wait. Then, pg_user doesn't list non-login roles?
2014-11-08 09:17:23	RhodiumToad	well, no, it only lists "users", which are login roles
2014-11-08 09:17:33	RhodiumToad	pg_roles lists login and non-login roles
2014-11-08 09:17:33	barosl	Oh, I see
2014-11-08 09:18:00	RhodiumToad	users and groups used to be separate things, but now they're not
2014-11-08 09:18:13	barosl	Yeah... pg_roles seems to be relevant to pg_authid
2014-11-08 09:18:17	RhodiumToad	now a user is a role that can log in, and a group is a role that has members - these can overlap

2014-11-08 09:19:02	RhodiumToad	though pg_group's definition of "group" is a role that can't log in, so there's some impedance mismatch there
2014-11-08 09:19:57	barosl	Haha. You're right
2014-11-08 09:20:22	barosl	It had to list non-login roles that have at least one members
2014-11-08 09:20:30	barosl	But no, because there can be empty groups
