2014-08-28 17:35:44	baumy	ive never had that problem, i see how it could be useful though
2014-08-28 17:35:52	baumy	people who use i3 are probably more likely to be people who use keyboard driven applications
2014-08-28 17:37:51	sergiodj	I use keyboard a lot
2014-08-28 17:38:02	sergiodj	but that doesn't mean I never use my mouse :)
2014-08-28 17:38:14	sergiodj	(unfortunately, of course!)
2014-08-28 17:38:48	baumy	the only thing i could imagine clicking on at the edge of the screen is a scrollbar
2014-08-28 17:38:58	baumy	in which case, if im holding the mouse, i also have a scrollwheel
2014-08-28 17:40:52	sergiodj	I almost don't use the scrollbar.  my problem is with the left edge.  sometimes I'm selecting text which is in the extreme left, in a browser
2014-08-28 17:41:11	sergiodj	and my mouse goes to the left monitor
2014-08-28 17:41:45	sergiodj	anyway, this is not a life-or-death thing, because I do that rarely.  however, I just experienced one of those annoying moments now, so I thought I'd ask here
