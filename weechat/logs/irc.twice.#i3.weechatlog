2014-08-28 17:35:44	baumy	ive never had that problem, i see how it could be useful though
2014-08-28 17:35:52	baumy	people who use i3 are probably more likely to be people who use keyboard driven applications
2014-08-28 17:37:51	sergiodj	I use keyboard a lot
2014-08-28 17:38:02	sergiodj	but that doesn't mean I never use my mouse :)
2014-08-28 17:38:14	sergiodj	(unfortunately, of course!)
2014-08-28 17:38:48	baumy	the only thing i could imagine clicking on at the edge of the screen is a scrollbar
2014-08-28 17:38:58	baumy	in which case, if im holding the mouse, i also have a scrollwheel
2014-08-28 17:40:52	sergiodj	I almost don't use the scrollbar.  my problem is with the left edge.  sometimes I'm selecting text which is in the extreme left, in a browser
2014-08-28 17:41:11	sergiodj	and my mouse goes to the left monitor
2014-08-28 17:41:45	sergiodj	anyway, this is not a life-or-death thing, because I do that rarely.  however, I just experienced one of those annoying moments now, so I thought I'd ask here

2014-09-10 15:08:39	Somelauw	If I create a file '.xsession' and I put the single line "i3" in it, would that work?
2014-09-10 15:11:22	okraits	hi Somelauw 
2014-09-10 15:11:40	okraits	normally you would write "exec i3"
2014-09-10 15:11:53	Somelauw	ok, that's all
2014-09-10 15:12:22	okraits	and i could imagine that the file should be executable
2014-09-10 15:13:27	Somelauw	This is actually an x-y problem. I want to change my keyboard layout, which can be done using 'setxbpmap'. But to make that persistent I needed to create a .xsession.
2014-09-10 15:14:17	okraits	No, you can set the keyboard layout in your X configuration as well.
2014-09-10 15:18:18	Somelauw	okraits: right now it's set to us-internation. i read some docs that said I should change 10-keyboard.conf, but i couldn't find an existion config file in Xession.d that does something like that
2014-09-10 15:18:36	Somelauw	An utility that would automatically change the keyboard in X configuration would be nice
2014-09-10 15:18:59	dagnachew	Somelauw: in .xinitrc exec i3
2014-09-10 15:19:08	Somelauw	and i could probably create a new file there, but i think it is better to change the exisitng one, isn' t it

2014-09-10 19:00:35	armin	hm, from what i see it's not possible to set the background colour of tabs in windows independent from the border colour in i3, which is especially annoying when showing those tabs but hiding titlebars for non-tabbed windows: http://netzverweigerer.de/foo.png when i alter the colour that affects the background of the tab (slight dark grey behind the irssi tab) it seems to also affect the borders. 
2014-09-10 19:01:26	armin	any workaround for this? i know it's a bit heavy to try to theme i3 like this, but from what i see a lot of people stumble upon this when colourizing i3.

2014-09-14 13:59:40	deterenkelt	Hsetroot was known to work earlier, but current version doesn’t support multi monitor screens and just stretches the wallpaper over the whole width

2014-09-14 16:24:47	michaelrose	feh is pretty lightweight
2014-09-14 16:26:15	michaelrose	as an aside on nice thing to do is make a shell function wherein say wp foo sets foo to the bg via feh, and uses imagemagick to convert to the format i3lock wants putting the output in a known location
2014-09-14 16:26:44	michaelrose	then a function lock which runs i3lock with that location as the background
2014-09-14 16:27:04	michaelrose	thusly wp foo sets your wallpaper and background to i3lock to the same image
2014-09-14 16:27:17	Score_Under	that would take a long time, it would definitely need caching
2014-09-14 16:27:57	michaelrose	it actually takes a tiny ammount of time
2014-09-14 16:28:36	michaelrose	    feh --bg-scale $argv
2014-09-14 16:28:36	michaelrose	    convert $argv -resize 1920x1080\! ~/.bgimage/img.png
2014-09-14 16:28:52	michaelrose	in fish in any case
2014-09-14 16:30:39	michaelrose	you could always set an environmental variable current dir and have a cron job run a function to select a random image from the current value of the environmental variable
2014-09-14 16:32:53	f8l	I can't see anything fish-specific here, but that's good.
2014-09-14 16:33:19	michaelrose	I mean the exact syntax
2014-09-14 16:33:41	michaelrose	which in this case just means replace $argv
2014-09-14 16:38:06	f8l	Ah, right. It would be $1 in sh.

2014-09-14 17:10:01	f8l	Score_Under: I never used feh for setting the backdrop, but I'd expect it's near instant. convert may take a long time, but you usually don't lock your screen just after setting a new backdrop.
2014-09-14 17:10:36	Score_Under	f8l, yeah, it's the convert. I was assuming you meant to perform the conversion in the lock scritp

2014-09-15 19:07:11	raincomplex	occasionally i'm getting graphical corruption on my i3bar, seems like it might be related to when i get notifications (dunst). i don't see anything like this on the bug tracker. anybody else getting this?
2014-09-15 19:09:13	michaelrose	raincomplex, have you tried twmnd
2014-09-15 19:10:50	michaelrose	I have 4.8.1 a recent version of dunst and don't experience any graphical corruption
2014-09-15 19:11:58	michaelrose	twmnd is just better as it can use an id to a given notification to allow it to be replaced rather than adding another notification or waiting for a timeout

2014-09-15 19:45:16	raincomplex	i'm not convinced it's dunst, just suspicious since it hadn't happened in a while and i just got a notif (they don't come too often) and it happened
2014-09-15 19:45:38	raincomplex	i can't reproduce it either
2014-09-15 19:45:49	raincomplex	and i'm on the latest versions of everything (arch packages)
2014-09-15 19:46:49	raincomplex	it clears itself up in a minute or two, also, which is weird. but it's not when the minute rolls over on the clock, because i saw it roll over once while it was still corrupted
2014-09-15 19:49:00	raincomplex	also iirc i'm on the proprietary nvidia drivers, so who knows

2014-09-20 18:05:05	~sECuRE	TonyC: i don’t feel so good reverting old bugfixes
2014-09-20 18:08:25	TonyC	sECuRE: well it seems to me that the fix is a workaround
2014-09-20 18:09:07	~sECuRE	nobody can tell, it’s behavior that’s not covered by the spec, so it’s neither a proper fix nor a workaround :|
2014-09-20 18:11:07	TonyC	well I guess you would run the risk of breaking older versions of eclipse
2014-09-20 18:12:10	~sECuRE	i’m not sure which versions of eclipse will be affected. what i’ll do is merge your patch “on probation”, i.e. if anyone complains about eclipse issues, i’ll revert it
2014-09-20 18:12:54	TonyC	maybe Ill get a debian wheezy machine up and test it there
2014-09-20 18:17:37	~sECuRE	i don’t think eclipse behaves differently on debian than on other distros. i’m not even sure if i could reproduce the bug for which the commit is
2014-09-20 18:21:42	FreezingCold	TonyC: menus are decent for a start :) question, do I need to apply that patch, or just rebuild git?
2014-09-20 18:22:51	~sECuRE	you need to apply the patch, as it was not yet merged
2014-09-20 18:23:12	FreezingCold	thanks, just noticed that after I hit enter
2014-09-20 18:23:26	TonyC	I get why you are cautious about this
2014-09-20 18:23:31	TonyC	office is clearly doing the wrong thing
2014-09-20 18:23:47	FreezingCold	Is it possible to do a whitelist just for office?
2014-09-20 18:24:48	TonyC	thats against i3 coding standards
2014-09-20 18:24:50	FreezingCold	TonyC: What do you mean the right click menu is broken?
2014-09-20 18:25:06	FreezingCold	It's not.
2014-09-20 18:25:41	TonyC	FreezingCold: I can't get the comboboxes to work in the right click menus
2014-09-20 18:26:30	FreezingCold	like you select text, right click that and you mean those menus?
2014-09-20 18:26:34	FreezingCold	Because those work fine for me
2014-09-20 18:26:54	TonyC	yeah they close for me, such as if you right click and try to change font size
2014-09-20 18:27:25	FreezingCold	don't see it.
2014-09-20 18:27:35	FreezingCold	anyway, you made the five MS office users happen lol
2014-09-20 18:28:05	TonyC	yes I hope all 5 of you appreciate that lol
2014-09-20 18:28:47	TonyC	given it doesnt break eclipse and it gets merge
2014-09-20 18:30:23	FreezingCold	still fine just to download the patch and rebuild if needed :) 
2014-09-20 18:30:50	FreezingCold	I just need Office since I'm in engineering, and a fair amount of university profs HATE change
2014-09-20 18:31:32	TonyC	let's just hope that microsoft fades away into consumer obscurity soon
2014-09-20 18:31:45	FreezingCold	lol
2014-09-20 18:31:48	FreezingCold	you wish
2014-09-20 18:32:13	TonyC	it could happen

2014-09-27 13:37:45	dwakar	f8l: I just saw that on someone's dot file in github so I tried that too thinking it might work
2014-09-27 13:38:23	Sanchal	scabdates: Try running `xev` and pressing the media keys while that window is focused, it will tell you if the keys still pick up or not, and what you need to use to bind them. Something might have changed on your system at some point to make them not detect correctly.
2014-09-27 13:38:27	f8l	dwakar: Does it work when you do the same manually?
2014-09-27 13:38:36	dwakar	what's the usual way to start redshift, I've tried everything that came to my mind

2014-10-11 13:53:44	okraits	th0rne: i just tried it out, but i don't have a clue how to focus the nagbar and select one option
2014-10-11 13:54:13	th0rne	So you have to dismiss it using the mouse?

2014-10-30 19:53:49	Sheepolution	Oh wait now that I think about it. I might have set something there that I haven't installed yet. Font or something

2014-10-30 20:39:48	michaelrose	is there any way to enable users to start a new session while using something simple like i3lock?
2014-10-30 20:43:03	michaelrose	it would be really useful if there was a way to use i3lock and switch users
2014-10-30 20:45:05	michaelrose	or if your i3 config could define keybindings for your a locked mode
2014-10-30 20:45:57	michaelrose	basically a set of bindings that would be active while i3lock was running
2014-10-30 20:46:51	michaelrose	useful for multimedia keys, shutting down, switching users

2014-10-30 20:52:39	Sanchal	michaelrose: The issue with lock screen on X, the simple ones can't do that.
2014-10-30 20:53:26	Sanchal	It has to be built into the locker otherwise you can't make it do anything else, because with the way X works the screenlocker can say "Give me full screen and all input focus" and X will just do it.

2014-10-30 21:39:41	michaelrose	would seem to be really easy to define a few bindings that work on the lockscreen in i3lock.config or whatever

2014-11-02 18:10:24	michaelrose	you would have to implement it yourself
2014-11-02 18:11:01	michaelrose	keep in mind that empty workspaces are already destroyed
2014-11-02 18:11:57	michaelrose	you could subscribe to workspace events ie changes in workspace to move windows around when you change away from empty workspaces

2014-11-02 18:26:25	opa	Is it possible to set absolute window sizes? Like have a hotkey to set a windows' height to 500px, for instance?
2014-11-02 18:30:59	michaelrose	it is possible to make a function that determines the current window size and resizes the current window by the difference

2014-11-08 09:08:10	maxtor	sECuRE: i suggest to remove all i3 commands and only support the messaging API. then, ship a set of scripts that use the messaging API. 
2014-11-08 09:09:04	maxtor	in addition to scripting the feature that i've been talking about

2014-11-08 09:49:43	badboy_	and please be a little patient. it's not like that the dev get paid to work on it
2014-11-08 09:56:16	~sECuRE	the devs usually don’t follow irc. if you have a reproducible bug, report it in the bugtracker and be patient, as badboy said
