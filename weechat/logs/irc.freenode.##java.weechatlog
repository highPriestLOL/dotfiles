2015-04-01 16:13:01	freeone3000	idletask: skip on a parallel line will absolutely skip a line, but... not the one you want.

2015-04-01 16:26:07	idletask	sreich: but there are two lessons to understand here; 1. you can't know, if you are passed a Stream, whether it's parallel or sequential but 2. this is "not a problem", as the terminal operations you use take precedence
2015-04-01 16:26:25	sreich	right
2015-04-01 16:27:12	idletask	sreich: for instance, if you .collect() using a Collector which doesn't have the CONCURRENT characteristic, then even if the _stream_ is CONCURRENT (before its Spliterator says so), then the implementation will acknowledge that and generate values sequentially, not in parallel

2015-04-01 16:54:47	mirak	since the awt library can support X on linux systems, do you think it could be rebuilt to support X on windows system, by using the cygwin framework ?

2015-04-01 17:00:31	mirak	In fact the vm solution could be nice, but a bit overkill, and I doubt we would be allowed to install a VM unfortunely since we are not admin of our computers at work. However you gave me the idea that with colinux it might be feasible, because unlike a full VM, it's like running a linux kernel like a windows executable. So a linux jvm could run inside a colinux instance, and run a xfvb.
2015-04-01 17:00:45	mirak	Thanks you for the idea of the vm :)
2015-04-01 17:01:54	mirak	I think the only blocking point would be the need to install a virtual network device to communicate with the vm.
