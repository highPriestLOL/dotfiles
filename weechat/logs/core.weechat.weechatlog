2014-08-23 21:34:27		/highmon clearbar will clear the contents of highmon's bar output
2014-08-23 21:34:27		/highmon monitor [channel] [server] is used to toggle a highlight monitoring on and off, this can be used in the channel buffer for the channel you wish to toggle, or be given with arguments e.g. /highmon monitor #weechat freenode
