2014-09-20 23:22:47	pnbeast	FreezingCold, that depends purely on what you install.  An install can still conceivably, and maybe even practically, be measured in MB, rather than GB.  OTOH, if you want to run all the common crapware that comes with a full install of many distros, I'm guessing it'll run into several GB, though 106 does seem big to me, too.

2014-09-22 19:19:22	deadmund	Ummm, I'm trying to find the fastest window manager.  I've found this page: http://l3net.wordpress.com/2013/03/17/a-memory-comparison-of-light-linux-desktops/   which lists the desktops based on how much RAM they use (at idle).  But that doesn't tell me much. I want to know which is fastest (best responsiveness)

2014-09-22 19:24:29	deadmund	KDE would probably feel faster.  I have 8GB of RAM.  The problem is that cinnamon is slow and I think it's a CPU / not optimized code problem.
2014-09-22 19:24:36	DoctorTrombone	deadmund: Ah yes. XFCE is a good choice for those who prefer a somewhat less minimalistic approach than Openbox.
2014-09-22 19:25:00	beekay201	how is xfce more minimalistic than openbox?
2014-09-22 19:25:15	beekay201	erm.
2014-09-22 19:25:16	deadmund	DoctorTrombone, Does XFCE use the openbox window manager?  Does LXDE?
2014-09-22 19:25:18	beekay201	sorry, misread.
2014-09-22 19:25:32	DoctorTrombone	deadmund: Accelerated graphics help with 2d performance a fair bit, are you sure you're not using the VESA driver?

2014-09-23 22:22:40	codebrainz	nmz787, if it installed a pkg-config file, you can use that to find your includes, or else just add it on your preprocessor/compiler flags with -I/your/prefix/include/whatever

2014-09-27 12:59:35	niluje	so another question, if you have a small file (a few Mbs) that you need to read sequentially, what is the advantage to mmap it (MAP_SHARED and PROT_READ) instead of read(2) it by blocks of 4096? (in the case only one process processes the file)

2014-09-27 13:01:23	niluje	I've submitted a patch for uboot, changing the use of mmap with read, and someone asked me what it implies in term of performances
2014-09-27 13:01:43	Harriobo	No I mean the log changes in /home/usr/log.log so how can I get it to go onto the webserver and take the log from /home/usr/log.log
2014-09-27 13:01:45	niluje	Because the file is read sequentially, I think this doesn't change anything, mmap being useful only when you need to make random access or to optimize memory
2014-09-27 13:01:59	reduce	so i logged into my linux server yesterday as root, switched to user1, and started running a program. I closed the putty window, and noticed when i later ssh-ed in again that the program i started was still running. This is what i wanted. But now, how can i got back to that session?

Strange part: from within the machine hosting it, while I can connect to it via hostname, I can't connect to it via the IP address of the local machine or the localhost address either.  Any idea what's happening?

At this point, it probably serves more as a "free taste" *for* people who will become matlab users.  But if the world's matlab users were smart, they join and contribute a pittance to octave devs and, within a few years, have a better tool they could use for free.

2014-10-04 21:35:31	qman__	stop referring to fdisk; it's useless when LVM is in play
2014-10-04 21:35:37	richac	lol
2014-10-04 21:35:40	qman__	it's the wrong tool for the job
2014-10-04 21:35:50	richac	i'm just annoyed that its giving errors now when before it didn't

2014-10-04 21:35:55	richac	lvs shows the correct info
2014-10-04 21:36:14	richac	and on fedora fdisk also says everything fine
2014-10-04 21:36:28	qman__	again, stop using fdisk
2014-10-04 21:36:32	qman__	it means nothing
2014-10-04 21:36:34	richac	the issue is because i tried to manually change the metadata for the fedora partition on mint,  and its still using it

2014-10-04 21:36:53	richac	i'll just ignore the error then
2014-10-04 21:37:08	qman__	I didn't say ignore the error, I said ignore fdisk
2014-10-04 21:37:20	richac	fdisk is what gives the error
2014-10-04 21:37:22	qman__	use the tools that actually know about LVM, GPT, and other new technologies
2014-10-04 21:37:31	richac	ya those don't give errors
2014-10-04 21:37:40	richac	but the error is only becaues of something I manually did
2014-10-04 21:37:51	richac	advice given to me from the fedora room
2014-10-04 21:38:10	richac	i ended up having to re-install anyways.....and now mint doesn't read the fedora partition right from fdisk
2014-10-04 21:38:13	richac	but i'll just ignore it

I have no idea how stressful that can be. I know continuous reading or writing is normal for operating systems, but maybe that's just a few bytes every second in the same place. Comments?

2014-10-08 19:14:03	xebra	koala_man, yes, in that case I think it makes sense because the two commands basically occur at the same time. The process I have in mind is more like: echo '200KB-of-data' > file; sleep 3; echo '200KB-of-new-data' > file; sleep 3; and so on...
2014-10-08 19:14:05	FlashSlayer	xebra: it would. XFCE is lightweight and simple but still has bugs and half-baked. KDE 3 was great, KDE 4 overbloated and inconvenient. Gnome - simple but inconveient for me.
2014-10-08 19:14:50	FlashSlayer	I wonder if KDE 4 runs smoothly on 512 MB RAM. KDE 3 worked fine on 256 MB.
2014-10-08 19:15:05	viscera	FlashSlayer: probably if you turn a lot of stuff off
2014-10-08 19:15:21	Senji	koala_man, "Shutdown hooks are called when the application terminates normally (when all threads finish, or when System.exit(0) is called). Also, when the JVM is shutting down due to external causes such as user requesting a termination (Ctrl+C), a SIGTERM being issued by O/S (normal kill command, without -9), or when the operating system is shutting down."
2014-10-08 19:15:26	viscera	FlashSlayer: I'd personally run just a simple WM.

2014-10-11 12:55:31	Terabyte	I have a java application that i'm running on ubuntu. So far it's been deployed as a tar.gz file, into the /opt/company/software/version directory. Now I have the opportunity to deploy it as a dpkg type package (like ubuntu would want it to be). I'm not sure which directories I should place my files. The application consists of a runscript, a script to start it up (i think this is in etc/init.d),
2014-10-11 12:55:31	Terabyte	a jar file (which the runscript points to), and a set of .properties configuration files which are passed in as arguments by the runscript. Does the distribution matter when making these choices? (does the answer to which directories i should install which  files in differ from ubuntu to centos etc for example)

2014-10-11 15:01:45	AMomchilov	I have a newbie question, please bear with me: I have a robot I'd with which I would like to be able to send commands and receive console output. I've found a way of doing it, but it's two seperate commands. In one terminal, I can run "socat - UDP-DATAGRAM:255.255.255.255:6668,broadcast,reuseaddr" to send commands, and in another terminal I can do "socat UDP-RECV:6666,broadcast,reuseaddr -" to see the output.
2014-10-11 15:01:59	AMomchilov	Is there any way of combining these two into one terminal, so it works kind of like a console?
2014-10-11 15:02:03	AlliMersey	https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/CpuFrequencyScaling can anyone help me with this? I don't know what to do at the Drivers setp.

I think the power supply has failed.  I really don't like the unit anymore and would love to take the drives out and put them into my desktop computer.  I would like to get the data off the drives intact though.  So... I need to move 4 drives in a RAID 5 set to a new computer.  Any tips or suggestions

A CD Drive starts to connect but then just seems to repeatedly disconnect. It never actually plays. The same drive works OK on a Windows machine (different machine).

It turns out that Unix email clients send outgoing email by invoking the Sendmail binary directly off the disk. This new Sendmail process simply attempts to deliver the message to its next hop directly, rather than communicating with the local Sendmail daemon running on the system. So while it is necessary to have a proper Sendmail configuration file on each local system, it is not

2014-10-11 16:12:39	richac	Having a Sendmail daemon listening on 25/tcp is what opens the system up for remote exploits like the recently announced buffer overflow issue. But note that the system only needs to be listening on 25/tcp if it is actively expecting to receive email messages from other systems. However, the only systems on the network that receive external email are the machines that are acting as mail servers and mail relays. A given site will typically only have a
2014-10-11 16:12:40	richac	small handful of these machines (many of which are Windows machines running Exchange these days anyway). The other 99.9% of the systems on the network are email "clients"-- that is they may emit email messages from time to time, but never expect to receive a message from another machine. On these machines it is probably best to simply disable the Sendmail daemon altogether in order to completely eliminate the potential for remote exploits.

2014-10-11 20:27:20	angevelon	i think i have an interesting thought experiment, so here goes- I want to use a linux mini image on a thumbdrive to boot a pc, and serve as the boot loader for a multi boot setup that has the windows user folder and the linux home folder/partition on a seperate drive

2014-10-11 20:28:22	angevelon	but i also want it to do whole hard disk encryption on all the drive, that is the user/home files drive and the primary system drives for both windows and linux

2014-10-11 20:29:48	CHVNX	angevelon: Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (or LUKS) allows you to encrypt partitions on your Linux computer.

2014-10-11 20:31:20	angevelon	but what about using luks to unlock a windows system drive and a seperate drive and THEN boot that os and the same with tails

2014-10-13 12:09:19	PinkPosixPXE	DarkriftX: I'm not sure how that automates the logging of the user's real name, unless you are sudo'ing up to the user's real account, and that account name is "John" for example. There is a way you can have users enter their name when they login to the shared user, so you can see it in the auth.log or secure log file, just prior to the 'su' or 'sudo' log entries. Allowing auditing of who did
2014-10-13 12:09:25	PinkPosixPXE	what (assuming they enter their real name), but the system can't guess their real name with no variable to provide it.

2014-10-13 12:14:41	heurist	serban: maybe make a script that does what you want instead of using a subshell which might not behave as expected under whatever shell cron uses. maybe use `` instead of $()  maybe try just getting the date command to work before you try with the compound ; statement.

If you want to learn more about the insides then I'd go with Gentoo or Arch as you can almost endlessly customize them to your liking. An 'in-between' would be Debian indeed since it requires some configuring to get to your liking.

2014-10-18 17:23:56	freeroute	supergeek800: that depends on what kind of user that is, personally I preferred eOS so everything worked out of the box and then transitioned into learning how to operate in the commandline.
2014-10-18 17:24:06	mwargh	freebsd, because if you'll use it as your workstation you'll have much more issues to solve than using arch
2014-10-18 17:24:09	pnbeast	micros, I didn't get as far as slapping it into a system command, but I put a bad "cp" command into a script, then ran it from my shell by typing "sh bad_cp.sh" and $? was, then, 1 instead of 0.  I'd be wary that a system() function might not *care* what a script returns, though.

2014-10-18 17:24:37	mikelr	LFS isn't too bad, but it's hard to use as a primary machine. Unless you know exactly what packages you'll need
2014-10-18 17:24:47	jonascj	archlinux is pretty good if you want something minimal (and rolling release). It will teach you the basics of how a modern linux distro is build (when you are finished setting your system up, that is)
2014-10-18 17:24:48	Drevkevac	question about video cards. How would linux react if I installed an AMD card in the same box as an nvidia card?
2014-10-18 17:24:49	mikelr	Maybe too much for a first distro
2014-10-18 17:25:00	mwargh	jonascj: that's really strange, are you sure you have multiple cores? i've seen one core i5 celeron somewhere
2014-10-18 17:25:02	peetaur	I tried building KDE on FreeBSD once... took like 15 hours and then failed.
2014-10-18 17:25:04	supergeek800	mwargh: Although Arch and Gentoo both are harder to install than FreeBSD or Slackware because they're entirely installed via console, while FreeBSD and Slackware have a Curses installer holding your hand a little bit.

2014-10-18 19:40:26	nullvibe	ok, just wanted to share a tidbit I discovered recently. Apparently, wine+mesa IS capable of hardware texture (de)compression (S3 Texture Compression to be specific) for games and other directx apps, but you need 'libtxc-dxtn', which seems to be available in most distros' third party non-free repos. I've confirmed that it works without appreciable slowdown on both the radeon and nouveau floss drivers

2014-10-19 23:23:15	crocket	Wikipedia says "Server provisioning is a set of actions to prepare a server with appropriate systems, data and software, and make it ready for network operation. Typical tasks when provisioning a server are: select a server from a pool of available servers, load the appropriate software (operating system, device drivers, middleware, and applications), appropriately customize and configure the system and the software to create or change a boot image
2014-10-19 23:23:15	crocket	 for this server, and then change its parameters, such as IP address, IP Gateway to find associated network and storage resources (sometimes separated as resource provisioning) to audit the system."

2014-10-19 23:24:18	crocket	To automate operating system provision with Salt easily, Salt needs abstractions or recipes for it.

2014-10-19 23:25:26	Psi-Jack	You can use salt to install a package, you can use salt to deploy a file after that package is installed. Done. Not much to it. 6 lines of yaml and a config file.
2014-10-19 23:26:13	crocket	Psi-Jack, If you need to write automation recipes for server provisioning, we need a higher abstraction.
2014-10-19 23:26:38	crocket	Do you tell
2014-10-19 23:26:53	Psi-Jack	There already IS "higher" abstraction. Salt supports your distros' native package manager.

2014-10-20 20:17:52	ackpacket	hey all, I was in here yesterday asking about the best way to sort a file in c.  Today i've found out this file is guaranteed to be less than 2GB.  With this new info, is it wise to try and load the whole file into memory and use a sort from stdlib?
2014-10-20 20:17:53	nullvibe	thedudez0r: the main benefit of gpt is in being able to name partitions and reference them by name, though ;)

2014-10-20 20:18:19	thedudez0r	nullvibe: but help me understand. an lvm is not a partition itself, but a program that handles partitions?

2014-10-20 20:18:52	nullvibe	thedudez0r: lvm is a block layer overlaid on top of other block devices such as disks

2014-10-20 20:20:03	nullvibe	thedudez0r: specifically, it provides block devices (LVs) in groups (VGs) of block devices (PVs). so at it's simplest, it's an abstraction layer for both vanity and preserving one's sanity

2014-10-20 22:53:53	turova	ok, so I think the relevant partition is my /dev/sda2 which in ubuntu is mounted as /boot/efi. I think that it SHOULD have a Microsoft folder in it, but it only has a BOOT, centos and ubuntu.
2014-10-20 22:54:01	turova	hugaraxia, MetaNova ^

2014-10-20 22:54:29	turova	The ubuntu one should be there since it's dual boot, but I think the centos install just deleted my microsoft on

2014-10-27 21:09:15	n1cky	coderego: most people that have used linux long enough scoff at the question of what distro to use. They're all extremely similar, when you get down to it.
2014-10-27 21:09:28	n1cky	when it comes to installing a distro with all the stock things, well yeah, they have different window managers.
2014-10-27 21:09:30	bsdbeard	n1cky, the repos are very different

2014-10-27 21:13:25	cubed_root	not sure...

2014-10-27 21:14:49	n1cky	cubed_root: definitely reinstall. You should be able to keep your homedir well.
2014-10-27 21:14:57	Iron_Chef	True
2014-10-27 21:15:20	n1cky	bsdbeard: that's the problem i have with release distros. Rolling is always the way to go.
2014-10-27 21:15:40	n1cky	it's all personal preference though. I wouldn't use arch if i wasn't okay with the idea that I could break things.

2014-10-28 21:29:16	nullvibe	then lsblk, and compare to 'df /' to see which is your root, then check /etc/fstab for the /boot it's using

I'm trying to run a minecraft server but I keep receiving an error that it's not able to contact the authserver.minecraft.com when using java.  if I run curl to the server it works fine and I see the packet count in iptables output, but if I run the game only (java) and have it try to connect to an auth server by trying to join the game, it fails and no packet count is
2014-10-28 21:33:52	tortib	 set.  There is more information about the problem here https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-71840

2014-10-31 22:08:16	boingolov	so the bragging rights are tempered with the admission that you never update your kernel
2014-10-31 22:08:19	pingfloyd	some servers take forever to boot
2014-10-31 22:08:20	eb0t	no im not richac

2014-10-31 22:08:41	boingolov	but I guess with ksplice that's not stricly true
2014-10-31 22:08:48	ananke	forget booting vms when spooling up new instances to accomodate changing load, nevermind booting embedded devices, yep. none of those things matter
2014-10-31 22:08:51	eb0t	i just decided to do my first linux install was arch linux with awesome window manager

2014-10-31 22:08:56	eb0t	then i did debian
2014-10-31 22:09:02	eb0t	and centos and then gentoo

2014-10-31 22:09:34	eb0t	and super fast
2014-10-31 22:09:36	jonatasbaldin	my first was ubuntu haha but in the way used suse, centos, gentoo, fedora

2014-10-31 22:10:09	richac	hardened gentoo
2014-10-31 22:10:10	eb0t	im still a beginner really ..i dont know much about linux but all that gentoo stuff helped
2014-10-31 22:10:10	boingolov	I like debian for home, and professionally most of the companies I've worked for have used rhel derivatives
2014-10-31 22:10:16	eb0t	like i can manually configure a kernel

2014-10-31 22:13:27	richac	boingolov:  well it took me a cuople tires on debian,  till i had right module flags set
2014-10-31 22:13:34	bsund	centos/rhel is very conservative
2014-10-31 22:13:39	plastic_saint	if you want to compile a kernel I've never had a lot of luck on RPM distros like CentOs/Fedora/SUSE. Go with Slackware, Arch, Gentoo, et al
2014-10-31 22:13:43	richac	but besides that,  it was easy to actually compile and boot into
2014-10-31 22:13:43	boingolov	I tend to prefer debian, but I can't fault the general consistency of rhel / centos / scientific linux repos
2014-10-31 22:13:46	bsund	it helps with security
2014-10-31 22:13:55	jonatasbaldin	does anyone trie
2014-10-31 22:14:02	jonatasbaldin	tried coreOS*?
2014-10-31 22:14:03	plastic_saint	even Debian and its children are easier to actually get the kernel source/headers
2014-10-31 22:14:09	eb0t	i actually prefer gentoo as it has only the stuff i use
2014-10-31 22:14:12	richac	i really wanted to do it on centos,  but the process is complicated,  and i couldn't find depencies
2014-10-31 22:14:16	eb0t	but i do have debian as my main install
2014-10-31 22:14:22	richac	on debian its much simpler commands
2014-10-31 22:14:29	richac	and easy to find packages
2014-10-31 22:14:30	pingfloyd	boingolov: debian is my favorite too
2014-10-31 22:14:42	richac	oh that was the other problem on opensuse,  they have no gcc plugin -dev package
2014-10-31 22:14:44	eb0t	yes its solid and a great support community
2014-10-31 22:14:58	richac	so you haev to set a special make flag,  and your basically missing out on some stuff
2014-10-31 22:15:05	plastic_saint	you should try just compiling it without using the package manager, imho-- back when I first used linux I had to install everything by hand, including the "bleeding edge" kernels I wanted
2014-10-31 22:15:10	pingfloyd	I feel so free an unencumbered on Debian, but that may be because it is what I started with
2014-10-31 22:15:14	richac	i actually got the kernel compiled on opensuse,  but it was flaky,  freezing up on me and stuff
2014-10-31 22:15:36	eb0t	wow now thats a pro
2014-10-31 22:15:36	richac	pingfloyd: no thats exactly i how i feel with debian,  your free to do anything you want,  and its easy to do so
2014-10-31 22:15:52	eb0t	building the kernel on one system and then copying it to another ...your close to genius
2014-10-31 22:15:53	pingfloyd	I think of Debian as the hacker distro

2014-10-31 22:16:16	pingfloyd	*mold it
2014-10-31 22:16:18	bsund	so less packages and simple stuff on rhel/centos
2014-10-31 22:16:35	richac	plastic_saint: i think eb0t got the right idea with gentoo and arc
2014-10-31 22:16:50	richac	*arch
2014-10-31 22:16:54	plastic_saint	gentoo is excellent-- but even it does a lot of hand holding now

2014-10-31 22:17:12	pingfloyd	the biggest pain if you have to go upstream, is validating the source
2014-10-31 22:17:14	eb0t	i would agree ...why waste time installing a system that is similar to widnows you dont learn anythign
2014-10-31 22:17:16	richac	plastic_saint: well i guess in that since then, yes i hear slackware is more free and open then debian
2014-10-31 22:17:19	plastic_saint	and Arch's wiki applies to other distros too
2014-10-31 22:17:25	eb0t	yes getnoo wiki and arch wiki are all you ever need really
2014-10-31 22:17:27	richac	ya Arch's wiki's are he best
2014-10-31 22:17:27	pingfloyd	but that's because some authors are bad about signing their work

2014-10-31 22:22:20	pingfloyd	jonatasbaldin: best option is create the package, others are to prefix to somewhere like say /usr/local/ or ~/local, for tracking the dependencies, that's where equivs comes in.

2014-10-31 22:23:44	pingfloyd	but here's one thing that is super easy that works with a lot of software.  Don't run make install, instead run from the source tree
2014-10-31 22:23:47	eb0t	which makes ccna
2014-10-31 22:23:50	bsund	cisco make their own language making everything seem more complicated than it is
2014-10-31 22:23:55	pingfloyd	if you're going to be updating it a lot, why not?

2014-10-31 23:14:11	richac	eb0t: they are using phones and tablets
2014-10-31 23:14:11	eb0t	they use office 365 on a tablet and
2014-10-31 23:14:26	eb0t	a bunch of apps
2014-10-31 23:14:34	plastic_saint	"apps"... I hate that term so much
2014-10-31 23:14:43	eb0t	but that data has to get to them from the cloud ....through the networks
2014-10-31 23:14:59	richac	eb0t: there is offce on tablet now?  wow i remember having to use some garbage word processor apps on ipad
2014-10-31 23:15:08	plastic_saint	as we all know, the data is transported by horse-drawn carriage
2014-10-31 23:15:11	eb0t	and the apps have to be written and supported
2014-10-31 23:15:13	eb0t	ha ha
2014-10-31 23:15:21	richac	plastic_saint: not to mention you can't do anything on a phone
2014-10-31 23:15:22	plastic_saint	and heavy users are like flipped over dump trucks inside those tunnels, blocking the horses
2014-10-31 23:15:35	richac	and the screen is so mall,  it actually hurts my eyes
2014-10-31 23:15:48	Jakey69	i want to know why is it hard to have Full GNU/Linux on arm phones
2014-10-31 23:15:53	eb0t	screen and keyboard is tiny
2014-10-31 23:15:56	plastic_saint	and that, children, is why the FCC is going to get rid of net neutrality. you don't want any dump trucks blocking your horses.
2014-10-31 23:15:57	eb0t	but they like it
2014-10-31 23:16:01	richac	can't type,  its not a computer replacement at all
2014-10-31 23:16:09	plastic_saint	Jakey69: drivers
2014-10-31 23:16:12	Jakey69	whats the different between archlinux on arm vs ubuntu
2014-10-31 23:16:15	richac	eb0t: i just explained to you,   its because they feel safer on their phone then they do their pc
2014-10-31 23:16:19	eb0t	its sub standard computing ....but they love it

2014-10-31 23:17:21	eb0t	yes
2014-10-31 23:17:34	plastic_saint	the problem is, the rights to the technology isn't owned (generally) by any one company
2014-10-31 23:17:37	richac	verizon and at&T have just been outed

2014-10-31 23:17:44	plastic_saint	so no one company has the right to open source the code

2014-11-01 00:28:21	XaF	Hello, I have a small problem and I was expecting that perhaps somebody could help. I updated my debian today and had some problems with network-manager, so I rebooted on an usb-key to be able to do the dist-upgrade that would install the update of network manager. I did that dist-upgrade in network manager. My system is installed on a luks encrypted LVM and the problem now is that once I've choosen my system in grub, it doesn't ask any
2014-11-01 00:28:21	XaF	more for the passphrase, it just says it doesn't find the system and stop. Is there a way to correct that?!
2014-11-01 00:29:04	plastic_saint	haha, yes, I'm a nurse
2014-11-01 00:29:05	plastic_saint	not

2014-11-02 15:34:07	ragingcake_	Need to run the command a number of times

2014-11-02 15:34:26	_Tassadar	JodaZ: it is cephfs and that doesn't play well with mtab

2014-11-02 15:35:21	_Tassadar	i think it is because cephfs mountpoints have a syntaxis that isn't mtab compliant

Buy an USB-Stick or a laptop with Linux preinstalled and use a convenient distro like Ubuntu, Mint or Elementary. Then, the Linux ecosystem would expand greatly, as most consumer software (think Photoshop, Maya, Games) would be ported/written for Linux.

2014-11-03 19:22:56	brotherBox	I have a lot of incremental backups which I created by "duplicity [...] . file:///path/to/storage", with . always being the home directory. Now I really like duply and decided to migrate since it allows profiles. For that purpose, I put my home dir into the duply config. Creating a backup however fails; there is a source folder mismatch. It has denoted the literal "." as the source, not $HOME. Is there anyway
2014-11-03 19:22:57	Disconsented	Or you just go look up the wikipedia list of browers and go HAM at that
2014-11-03 19:22:58	brotherBox	I can resolve this without the ugly allow-source-mismatch parameter?

2014-11-03 21:41:42	soLucien	Hi guys ! Once again , i'm asking the same question from earlier in hope of another answer . I'm running Ubuntu on a laptop partition , and it holds my dev environment. I got a number of IDEs, web servers , database servers ,php/jdk/python/etc, Terminator, maven, ant, ... and many others. I went through a lot of documentation reading and configuring ports/permissions to get to this point and so far things are fine.
2014-11-03 21:41:49	toothe	is there no terminal that fits my needs?
2014-11-03 21:41:50	toothe	woe is me

2014-11-04 22:05:43	iio7	I need some help understanding file permissions. I have a samba share which is mounted on a Debian box. When I copy a directory from the share to the box I get the following permissions: http://pastebin.com/q6iZL9B1, but when I (as user foo) try to access the folder I get "permission denied". Can anyone explain why?

2014-11-08 09:55:25	wz1000	peetaur: Can't that pid get reassigned?
2014-11-08 09:55:58	peetaur	wz1000: just kill the pid only if /proc/$pid/cmdline or $(readlink -f /proc/$pid/exe) matches expected

2014-11-08 09:56:25	peetaur	wz1000: yes, so you can look in proc to make sure it's the right command ... which is not enough if it's /bin/bash, etc. but might be enough

2014-11-08 09:57:09	bewees	Hi, I am kind of stuck with qemu and vde. qemu nic backend doesn't connect to the vlan0 of vde's switch. I started vde qemu/kvm with: `sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -net vde,vlan=0,sock=/tmp/vde.ctl -net nic,vlan=0,macaddr=52:54:00:00:AA:04 -hda node1.qcow -boot d -m 1024` and I started vde's switch with: `sudo vde_switch -F -tap tap0 -group user -mod 777 -s /tmp/vde.ctl`. tap0 got these ip settings `sudo ifconfig
2014-11-08 09:57:09	bewees	tap0 192.168.10.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up`. After running qemu/kvm this warning appears:  "Warning: vlan 0 is not connected to host network"

2014-11-08 09:58:09	wz1000	Wait, that still may fail because I am running instances of urxvt, and I use a lot of terminal windows.
