2015-04-01 16:23:04	breakingthings	swapnesh: In as few words as possible: If you want to use JWTs, you will need to have an api endpoint that you use to authenticate the user (eg. have them send their username & password), which should return an access token (jwt), and they should send an "Authorization" header containing the token for every subsequent request to the API. The API should validate the token on every request. Your API will need to be HTTPS from end-to-end.
