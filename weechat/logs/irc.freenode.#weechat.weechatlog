2014-09-01 13:50:13	Desu	:(
2014-09-01 13:50:17	wysiwtf	also it helps to reduce the number of ports from the default random >1024

2014-09-01 13:51:11	wysiwtf	which means you only get public ipv6 addressesm ipv4 only through carrier grade nat
2014-09-01 13:51:17	Desu	my isp claims they support ipv6
2014-09-01 13:51:23	@FlashCode	but I'm waiting for fiber, which is nit planned before many years :/
2014-09-01 13:51:24	Desu	but they don't
2014-09-01 13:51:30	@FlashCode	not*
2014-09-01 13:51:42	Desu	by support ipv6 they mean that the router they supply can do ipv6 on the lan :p
2014-09-01 13:52:06	farn	jcbjoe: try selecting while holding shift or ctrl or option or any combination of those
2014-09-01 13:52:49	jcbjoe	shift works

2014-09-01 15:45:51	c74d	sounds good, but how does one have an always-stable master branch without having unstable testing branches?
2014-09-01 15:46:04	grawity	this reminds me, currently I use os.popen() in a script, to run a helper tool that I need the exit code of
2014-09-01 15:46:26	@FlashCode	which is used (only) for tab completion
2014-09-01 15:46:28	phy1729	c74d: you just remember the hashes of the unstable commits
2014-09-01 15:46:29	grawity	but over time, I get a few zombie processes accumulated because Weechat seems to ignore *some* SIGCHLDs
2014-09-01 15:46:34	@FlashCode	with arraylist, tab completion is ~50x faster
2014-09-01 15:46:51	@FlashCode	and I'll use arraylist for options soon (I expect startup ~50x faster too)

2014-09-01 15:53:39	Naama	I also disagree with the colors, but that's pretty much the only thing.
2014-09-01 15:53:46	Naama	I'm just not a color person.
2014-09-01 15:53:52	prawnsalad	hi, ive head you can use weechat as a bnc, is this true?
2014-09-01 15:53:56	jidar	FlashCode: you checked that into git yet? checking now
2014-09-01 15:54:13	kelnoky	the colors depend mostly on your terminal color scheme
2014-09-01 15:54:31	kelnoky	the same thing can look vastly different when you have defined your colors nicely
2014-09-01 15:54:41	farn	prawnsalad: it is. you can create an IRC relay
2014-09-01 15:54:43	Naama	Yeah, I meant the whole nick-coloring thing.
2014-09-01 15:55:10	prawnsalad	farn: any info on this? i can only find "realy" which doesnt appear to be a standard irc bnc
2014-09-01 15:55:15	nw`	The only default I think you should change is setting weechat to ask for away-notify.  Speakin' of which, I've got a script using hook_signal on "*,irc_in2_away" but it's never getting called.  What might be my problem here, is the in2 never called for away as it's ignored?  If so what should I hook instead?
2014-09-01 15:55:30	@FlashCode	prawnsalad: http://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#relay_irc_proxy
2014-09-01 15:56:06	farn	colors are awesome. like adding an entire dimension to your vision
2014-09-01 15:56:06	prawnsalad	hm, so it is the relay. will read over that, cheers

2014-09-20 15:52:22	nils_2	weechat does not use themes. there is a theme.py script but its only for color settings. simply use iset.pl script to change options

2014-09-20 15:53:17	haavard	Can I hide the input/status bar from a window?

2014-09-27 13:03:07	GermainZ	If you don't have iset, either install it (/script install iset.pl) or use `/set` instead, e.g. `/set *.autojoin`
2014-09-27 13:03:30	dagnachew	GermainZ: I have already a list to autojoin and I want to add another channel
2014-09-27 13:03:55	GermainZ	dagnachew: yes, iset will allow you to edit a value (which means you can append something to it)
2014-09-27 13:03:59	GermainZ	Same with /set if you press tab

2014-10-11 16:37:43	gb	no you are using something 2 years old not current stable
2014-10-11 16:38:38	gb	ssl will still work on it but you are depiving yourself of a lot of features
2014-10-11 16:39:33	aY0r14	ok, let me install the stable version
2014-10-11 16:40:54	 *	gb still runs .3.2 on one machine but not something i recommend doing

2014-10-11 16:53:54	gb	aY0r14: it doesn't really matter what version you run but the .3.x versions did have some issues with ssl fixed by .3.8 i think but no doubt they are fixed in the dev version you have now
2014-10-11 16:54:12	aY0r14	excellent
2014-10-11 16:54:32	gb	makes it easier to setup something if you do not have to work around known bugs

2014-11-07 18:37:19	Evropi	you have to use a script if you want to just append to my knowledge :/

2014-11-07 18:37:48	dagnachew	Evropi: I have my autoconnect list and I want to append some more channels
2014-11-07 18:38:05	Evropi	autoconnect is for servers, autojoin is for channels within servers
2014-11-07 18:38:28	dagnachew	Evropi: here some one showed me to append to list
2014-11-07 18:38:56	Evropi	personnaly I use the "autojoinem.py" script for that
2014-11-07 18:39:05	Evropi	which lets you tab-complete your way to adding a channel

2014-11-07 18:39:45	Evropi	I think that's the only script that does that come to think of it, but yeah I don't think there's a built in way to append channels to autojoin or any string really
2014-11-07 18:39:46	dagnachew	Evropi: let say you have a list of channels for freenode and you want to add new ones how do you do it ?
2014-11-07 18:40:32	Evropi	/autoj<TAB> <TAB> <TAB> name<TAB>
2014-11-07 18:40:40	Evropi	or something like that ;)
2014-11-07 18:40:57	Evropi	sometimes I do it with good ol iset
2014-11-07 18:41:19	Evropi	ctrl+left/right arrow skips over whole words which makes it easy to add channels to the end of your autojoin string

2014-11-07 19:06:40	Yaniel	use iset
2014-11-07 19:06:59	Yaniel	it gives you a /set command with the current list

2014-11-07 19:15:09	Yaniel	works for me
2014-11-07 19:15:25	Yaniel	note  that with esc you need to press and release esc, then press enter
2014-11-07 19:15:41	Yaniel	the top bar shows the keys
