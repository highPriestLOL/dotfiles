2014-08-31 22:38:12	BeepDog	http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf this doesn't count as the scala language specification?
2014-08-31 22:38:17	dibblego	leden: there is very little to learn from Scala specifically, if you have experience in other environments, such as DDC or Haskell
2014-08-31 22:38:43	BeepDog	I'm jumping in the middle, but there's also scala.js which implements most of the scala language
2014-08-31 22:38:48	BeepDog	minus a few things
2014-08-31 22:39:18	deuteros	saying "scala.js implements scala" is... a bit of a jaw dropper
2014-08-31 22:39:25	BeepDog	http://www.scala-js.org/doc/semantics.html
2014-08-31 22:39:28	dibblego	minus a few things
2014-08-31 22:39:28	deuteros	I don't even know how to answer to that
2014-08-31 22:39:38	BeepDog	you can write scala, and get javascript out 
2014-08-31 22:39:40	deuteros	ah right, "minus a few things" makes it an unfalsifiable statement
2014-08-31 22:39:42	BeepDog	modulo a couple things
2014-08-31 22:39:42	dibblego	main = error "todo: scala"
2014-08-31 22:39:50	BeepDog	and I gave you the list of minuses :P
2014-08-31 22:39:57	BeepDog	so I don't think I'm making absurd claims here
2014-08-31 22:40:19	leden	BeepDog: thanks
2014-08-31 22:40:29	dibblego	I will make a stronger claim; not only is it never been done — it is not possible.
2014-08-31 22:40:37	BeepDog	that's a pretty big claim there
2014-08-31 22:40:38	deuteros	BeepDog: I think you are. scala.js is a backend, a code generator.

2014-08-31 22:41:40	dibblego	then you learn that the answer is deeply embedded in scalac

2014-08-31 22:41:49	dibblego	and you go hunting through scalac
2014-08-31 22:42:07	dibblego	and then you find yourself in a world of hurt as scalac does not even implement a language specification at all

2014-08-31 22:43:13	dibblego	oh yes, acknowledging matters of fact is "being mad", "not feeling good" and "bashing languages"
2014-08-31 22:43:17	dibblego	I totally forgot how that shit works 
2014-08-31 22:43:22	BeepDog	u mad bro?
2014-08-31 22:43:31	BeepDog	because I don't actually care too much if scala implements a spec strictly or not

2014-08-31 22:44:16	BeepDog	sorry, I'm probably using words poorly
2014-08-31 22:44:20	dibblego	nobody has ever done, nobody ever will

2014-08-31 22:44:38	BeepDog	fair enough, I assumed you were bashing scala because it didn't have a spec, and that it was a bad thing
2014-08-31 22:44:39	dibblego	maybe you'll get a different answer, but I doubt it

2014-08-31 22:44:53	BeepDog	and dunce usually has a negative connotation
2014-08-31 22:45:18	dibblego	well yes, Ruby is unredeeming nonsense, so to say, "but Ruby does it too", really adds nothing interesting
2014-08-31 22:45:26	dibblego	it is just a fact
2014-08-31 22:45:35	BeepDog	so what's the point of not having a spec? or is there a point?

2014-08-31 22:46:52	dibblego	to be useful, one must define a gaol
2014-08-31 22:46:53	dibblego	*goal
2014-08-31 22:47:03	BeepDog	why?
2014-08-31 22:47:04	dibblego	after all, java is useful if the goal is, "to use a programming language that starts with J"
2014-08-31 22:47:08	qu1j0t3	scrum feels like a gaol
2014-08-31 22:47:12	dibblego	otherwise, we can just shift the goal posts around
2014-08-31 22:47:29	dibblego	if you fix the goal posts, then analyse usefulness, you can come to some meaningful conclusions
2014-08-31 22:47:39	dibblego	if you shift the goal posts around, you just trick yourself
2014-08-31 22:48:00	dibblego	"Yes, Ruby is useful, because I once had my webapp running in 5 minutes, with database and everything!"
2014-08-31 22:48:07	dibblego	precision is important in this context
2014-08-31 22:48:08	BeepDog	that's an oversimplification
2014-08-31 22:48:55	dibblego	as to the goal of "writing correct software in an optimised amount of time", then no, neither Ruby nor Scala are useful
2014-08-31 22:49:11	dibblego	that this is not obvious has puzzled me for a long time

2014-09-01 15:26:51	pfn	it's interesting that macros don't generate synthetic line numbers in the bytecode
2014-09-01 15:27:36	witquicked	you're way ahead of me on this :)
2014-09-01 15:27:56	witquicked	i'm still wrapping my head around the -Ymacro-debug-lite
2014-09-01 15:28:53	pfn	why are you trying to debug an sbt plugin anyway
2014-09-01 15:29:10	witquicked	because it's not behaving as expected
2014-09-01 15:29:16	witquicked	but good question
2014-09-01 15:29:41	witquicked	it's the sbt-liquibase plugin, the most recent from github.com/rfranco
2014-09-01 15:29:53	pfurla	pfn: you can invoke the compiler from the runtime jvm
2014-09-01 15:30:07	witquicked	so i know how liquibase works with maven or from the command line
2014-09-01 15:30:29	witquicked	but there's something funky about the way it's behaving via the sbt integration
2014-09-01 15:30:35	pfurla	liquidbase? the fuego thing?
2014-09-01 15:30:50	witquicked	liquibase.org
2014-09-01 15:31:11	pfurla	bea bpm
2014-09-01 15:31:54	pfurla	or whatever
2014-09-01 15:32:07	witquicked	not sure what 'bea bpm' means?

2014-09-09 22:21:43	dibblego	the more you, me or others do it, the more the actual problem of "lack of progress in general" persists
2014-09-09 22:22:12	dibblego	so, if someone says, "where is my scala job?", you inform them that they are contributing to the issue by the very act of asking this misintegrated question
2014-09-09 22:22:18	dibblego	where are the jobs such that I may use the public keyword on line numbers that are also perfect squares?
2014-09-09 22:22:22	dibblego	sounds like a ridiculus question right?

2014-09-10 15:19:05	S11001001	phooby: you probably need to say more about the A in question.  Can you post an example that doesn't compile of what you're trying to do on http://scastie.org ?
2014-09-10 15:20:54	tpolecat	well. that compiles and it works

2014-09-10 15:22:23	S11001001	like, if Bar is wide open, then you haven't proven much useful by finding a valid A in this case.
2014-09-10 15:23:24	S11001001	so I suppose I mean "type *Bar* of what?", phooby .  Sorry for the confusion.
2014-09-10 15:23:52	phooby	well, let's say that i have like, trait Entity { type Id; def id:Id } and then def method[A <: Entity](param: EntityOps { type Id = A#Id }) { ...} makes more sense?

2014-09-13 17:55:25	agenovese	I’m trying to define a function which takes 2 collections of the same size and with the same types and performs an operation on them. I’d like to have the types guarantee that the collections are of the same size and types. is there an existing collection I could use for this purpose?
2014-09-13 17:56:04	aarvar	you can use shapeless.Sized I think
2014-09-13 17:56:17	alexbobp	you can zip them :P
2014-09-13 17:56:42	alexbobp	if a single collection of tuples will still work well for your purposes
2014-09-13 17:56:46	OlegYch5	shapeless HList and Sized
2014-09-13 17:57:20	alexbobp	but yeah unless you zip them you do need something with dependent types like shapeless
2014-09-13 17:57:57	agenovese	ok, thanks for the tip, I’ll have a look at those. (Haven’t used Shapeless yet ;))
2014-09-13 17:58:10	aarvar	! shapeless.Sized(1, 2, 3)

2014-09-14 15:21:35	LuxuryMode	When I first started doing FP, I would do things like IO[Unit] but I'd have that sprinkled everywhere and would be unsafeperforming right after, so i had no benefit from it
2014-09-14 15:21:42	mcamou	the fact is, at least at this point, we're talking about Scala as it is right now
2014-09-14 15:21:51	mcamou	with all its warts
2014-09-14 15:21:51	LuxuryMode	the whole idea is to really build up a fully referentially transparent program
2014-09-14 15:21:59	LuxuryMode	and then running it "at the last moment"
2014-09-14 15:22:09	LuxuryMode	so now you can reason about your program, compose it

2014-09-14 15:22:58	mcamou	aarvar: so we're not talking about complete purity here, since we have mutable references

2014-09-15 19:20:37	Guest47278	hi guys.  I hope no-one takes this as a troll question.  I'm interested in functional programming - I've some Haskell experience, a little Scala experience, and an extremely scarce knowledge of Clojure.
2014-09-15 19:20:58	tpolecat	welcome
2014-09-15 19:20:59	Guest47278	Do you guys find Scala to be too much of a compromise, with its OO stuff?
2014-09-15 19:21:07	Guest47278	hey dude.
2014-09-15 19:21:08	tpolecat	yes.

2014-09-15 19:21:52	Guest47278	I've been learning Scala on and off for the past year.  Reality keeps biting me and I have to focus on my more practical day-to-day work tech skills
2014-09-15 19:22:16	Guest47278	I fear that my motivations for learning Scala last year weren't really for the right reasons - not sure whether to carry on, or whether to go more purely functional like Clojure
2014-09-15 19:22:39	tpolecat	well scala is certainly better than clojure in this regard
2014-09-15 19:22:40	wabash	what would the wrong reasons be?
2014-09-15 19:22:41	Guest47278	i.e. I guess, is the main reason to choose Scala over Clojure just to cater to organizational/tech constraints?

2014-09-15 19:23:15	tpolecat	no, the reason is that you can write programs that work in scala because you have more than one type.

2014-09-15 21:22:32	masoon	for example, what if the program you thought worked isn't working. can you repair the bug at runtime, without stopping execution and starting over?
2014-09-15 21:22:46	masoon	is this possible in haskell?
2014-09-15 21:22:48	dibblego	excellent question
2014-09-15 21:22:55	masoon	or, to be topical, scala
2014-09-15 21:23:00	dibblego	not only is it possible, it is *impossible* in almost every other environment
2014-09-15 21:23:14	dibblego	show me this "repaired bug" in say, clojure and I will show you a clown suit
2014-09-15 21:23:32	dibblego	we don't even have the most trivial of abstractions, it's *only bugs*
2014-09-15 21:24:24	dibblego	working programs ∴ not elephants nor clojure

2014-09-15 21:25:31	masoon	I don't know clojure well enough. but I recall reading about an anegdote about a NASA robot running a CL program with a bug that was discovered after it has already been deployed. it was fixed without ever stopping it (from earth, not that it matters, but cool none the less :P )
2014-09-15 21:25:51	masoon	also, erlang is famous for its ability to hot swap code
2014-09-15 21:26:34	dibblego	yeah I don't mind feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside with stories like that, but I am careful not to draw outrageous conclusions on them
2014-09-15 21:27:18	masoon	what outregeous conclusion would those be?
2014-09-15 21:27:24	dibblego	I'm really a fan of progress more than anything, and clojure is very much against this
2014-09-15 21:27:27	masoon	erlang programs run for years, while being actively developed

2014-09-15 21:27:43	dibblego	yes but why is this? because "erlang"?
2014-09-15 21:27:59	mdedetrich	I must be god, since I have written working programs in clojure
2014-09-15 21:28:04	dibblego	it really is such a trivial, over-celebrated thing
2014-09-15 21:28:19	mdedetrich	either that, or I am a magician
2014-09-15 21:28:21	masoon	topic was wider than scala vs clojure, it was static vs dynamic typing. erlang is dynamically typed
2014-09-15 21:28:34	dibblego	this is unrelated to impractical type systems
2014-09-15 21:28:57	dibblego	I can do it in haskell, so what?
2014-09-15 21:28:58	jedws_	mdedetrich people have created working programs in brainfuck, so what?
2014-09-15 21:29:07	jedws_	also machine code

2014-09-15 21:30:13	masoon	dibbleago I don't think it is a trivial thing. I have never programmed in erlang, but I did find the ability to update code live in CL without restarting the environment (and setting everything up again each time you recompile) quite useful

2014-09-17 22:59:24	suyase	no, if I use any ref, then serialization fails

2014-09-17 23:27:12	suyase	and cannot be easily made available at compile time

2014-09-17 23:28:36	aarvar	the problem is that this information is available whether you ask for it or not
2014-09-17 23:28:37	suyase	compile time information in one part of an architecture isn't compile time information for the entire system =P
2014-09-17 23:29:00	aarvar	well, some of it is, generic types get erased
2014-09-17 23:29:16	suyase	aarvar: ya

2014-09-17 23:29:38	suyase	aarvar: it's just done poorly
2014-09-17 23:29:48	aarvar	if you allow reflection, then a method def foo(a: A): A could do practically anything based on the type
2014-09-17 23:30:19	aarvar	it could inspect whether a is a String, and if so do something completely different than if a is an Int
2014-09-17 23:30:23	deuteros__	if you allow (anything that violates totality) you can do practically anything
2014-09-17 23:31:13	suyase	aarvar: yea
2014-09-17 23:32:20	aarvar	if you do need information about A at runtime, then it makes more sense to have something like def foo[A](a: A)(implicit tag: ClassTag[A])
2014-09-17 23:32:31	aarvar	where the compiler generates the implicit
2014-09-17 23:32:47	suyase	aarvar: hell, you could write all your applications as collections of methods that take one argument (some kind of blob) and have a single method that you call over and over with whatever arguments, and it builds blobs and dispatches them to the appropriate method, assuming that the set of arguments for each method is mutually exclusive with regard to types
2014-09-17 23:32:54	aarvar	and if you need to inspect the type of a, then you can have a type class for that as well
2014-09-17 23:34:23	aarvar	anyway, reflection should be avoided because it makes it impossible to reason about types

2014-09-28 21:56:47	Schatten	And to avoid having to annotate the type

2014-09-28 22:09:53	qu1j0t3	that's a different issue. but if you mean "how do I tell sbt which version of scala I want to compile with", that's possible.
2014-09-28 22:09:55	suyase	qu1j0t3: but in this particular case, I'm not sure it fixes my problem
2014-09-28 22:09:59	qu1j0t3	it may not.

2014-09-28 22:11:41	suyase	qu1j0t3: the problem is java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.Predef$.ArrowAssoc being thrown from my code when I run the project importing my code - the offending line of code is just Map[String, String]("a" -> "b"))
2014-09-28 22:11:54	qu1j0t3	"importing your code"?
2014-09-28 22:11:59	qu1j0t3	are you shipping a jar?
2014-09-28 22:12:05	suyase	qu1j0t3: yes
2014-09-28 22:12:12	qu1j0t3	so, why don't you suspect a version mismatch?
2014-09-28 22:12:20	suyase	qu1j0t3: why don't I?
2014-09-28 22:12:27	suyase	qu1j0t3: I do suspect a version mismatch.
2014-09-28 22:12:34	qu1j0t3	and if you DO, why do you think that setting the scala version to compile with, won't fix it?
2014-09-28 22:12:55	qu1j0t3	did you try that? setting the scala version to the same as the project that imports your jar?
2014-09-28 22:12:59	suyase	qu1j0t3: because I've set the scala version to the exact version used by the project importing my code already and observe the same problem
2014-09-28 22:13:25	qu1j0t3	how are you running the overall application?
2014-09-28 22:13:35	qu1j0t3	are all the scala runtime on the classpath?
2014-09-28 22:14:50	suyase	qu1j0t3: so...this particular application loads a scala script at runtime and executes it; the script contains a domain specific language for the application - I've exported some functionality of my script into external files without dependencies, compiled them, and then dropped the jar into the libs directory of the application

2014-09-28 22:17:22	qu1j0t3	so, your next step is to verify that your jar includes THAT class.
2014-09-28 22:17:23	qu1j0t3	does it?
2014-09-28 22:17:24	suyase	qu1j0t3: does the runtime need to be bundled with every single library jar?
2014-09-28 22:17:33	qu1j0t3	it needs to be available at runtime, yes.

2014-09-28 22:18:35	suyase	qu1j0t3: you can just vim it, it's more convenient
2014-09-28 22:18:38	qu1j0t3	so you need to ensure that class is available at runtime, through classpath.

2014-09-28 22:20:02	qu1j0t3	suyase: so is it or not?
2014-09-28 22:20:19	Dirm	Schatten: and maybe it would or wouldn't be nicer if it were a standard language feature
2014-09-28 22:20:20	qu1j0t3	suyase: basically, it's not. so you have two options, either bundle the runtime into the jar, or fix the classpath

2014-09-28 22:20:36	qu1j0t3	suyase: so the runner script includes the scala runtime jars?
2014-09-28 22:20:36	Dirm	Schatten: but if I saw that in someone's code base I'd probably curse as I tried to figure out what the hell _( meant
2014-09-28 22:20:43	Schatten	Haha
2014-09-28 22:20:47	suyase	qu1j0t3: to reiterate:
2014-09-28 22:20:59	Dirm	I mean, if it's an operation you're doing frequently, maybe it's worth it
2014-09-28 22:21:02	Schatten	Dirm, well, you could still use .apply or think of a better name
2014-09-28 22:21:19	suyase	qu1j0t3: previously, all of the code that I exported to a separate project and started compiling into jars was in-line in the script that the application loads and was running without any issues
2014-09-28 22:21:43	qu1j0t3	you said the runtime was on the classpath. did you verify that?
2014-09-28 22:22:03	suyase	qu1j0t3: indicating that if scala core libraries were unavailable when the script was loaded and run by the application, it would've failed, meaning they're available, no?
2014-09-28 22:22:12	qu1j0t3	it did fail.
2014-09-28 22:22:24	Schatten	It was just an idea that came up and I asked myself if something like this could be useful to have in the std lib

2014-09-28 22:31:22	qu1j0t3	why don't you just inspect the runner script and see what classpath it's using.
2014-09-28 22:31:36	suyase	qu1j0t3: I can literally take the code in this .scala file verbatim and copy paste it into the script being loaded by that application

2014-09-28 22:32:08	suyase	qu1j0t3: indicating that the class you're saying isn't available on the classpath, is available on the classpath
2014-09-28 22:32:19	qu1j0t3	would it be so hard just to inspect that script?

2014-09-28 22:38:08	qu1j0t3	is the main app scala?
2014-09-28 22:38:08	fifosine	Is it possible to do this with a match statement?
2014-09-28 22:38:12	qu1j0t3	sounds like it's java, no?
2014-09-28 22:38:17	suyase	qu1j0t3: the main app is not java
2014-09-28 22:38:21	suyase	qu1j0t3: it's a scala app

2014-09-28 22:39:20	suyase	qu1j0t3: i feel like it's a version issue for some reason
2014-09-28 22:39:23	suyase	qu1j0t3: no idea why
2014-09-28 22:39:27	qu1j0t3	suyase: i see
2014-09-28 22:39:37	qu1j0t3	suyase: well, i think we ruled that out. You're 100% sure the build versions are now the same.
2014-09-28 22:39:53	suyase	well, I'm not 100%
2014-09-28 22:40:16	qu1j0t3	where is it set in the master app? 
2014-09-28 22:40:17	suyase	as I mentioned, this is a pre-built release of the application - I didn't build it, so I'm not sure what it was built with
2014-09-28 22:40:22	qu1j0t3	ohjhhhhhhh

2014-09-28 22:40:44	qu1j0t3	then a version problem is a good theory and might explain the apparent contradiction.
2014-09-28 22:40:48	suyase	qu1j0t3: I checked the build.version for the same release, but that doesn't actually verify it
2014-09-28 22:40:52	qu1j0t3	right.
2014-09-28 22:41:00	qu1j0t3	can you rebuild the app yourself?

2014-10-01 19:31:28	folex	most people doesn't care
2014-10-01 19:31:35	aarvar	code golfing? isn't that the thing where you try to write the shortest code possible
2014-10-01 19:31:46	QF-MichaelK	aarvar: Yes.
2014-10-01 19:31:51	aarvar	just use haskell, problem solved

2014-10-02 17:40:47	vozz	Can you pattern match function args like you can in haskell? eg ((firstThingInTuple, secondThingInTuple)) => {doSomethingToFirstThing(firstThingInTuple)}
2014-10-02 17:41:02		echeipesh (~echeipesh@216.158.51.82) has joined #scala
2014-10-02 17:41:12	alexbobp	that looks like just pattern matching tuple values.  yes you can.
2014-10-02 17:41:18	alexbobp	I don't know what you mean by pattern match function args
2014-10-02 17:41:37	tpolecat	you can define a function literal by cases, like { case (a, b) => ...  } 
2014-10-02 17:41:39	alexbobp	the pattern looks like what you showed but without the extra st of parentheses
2014-10-02 17:41:53	tpolecat	given sufficient type context
2014-10-02 17:42:04	Arrgh	Scala method dispatch is not the same as Haskell's; tuples are not generally used for multiple arguments (only multiple return values)
2014-10-02 17:42:06	alexbobp	ohhh function args as in args to the pattern match
2014-10-02 17:42:27	alexbobp	yeah what Arrgh said.  a pattern match is always on one value, a tuple.
2014-10-02 17:42:37	Arrgh	You can say def f(a: String, b: Int) = { (a,b) match { case (aString, anInt) => ... } } but I wouldn't call that idiomatic
2014-10-02 17:42:38	alexbobp	so it's like the .tupled version of a function.
2014-10-02 17:42:48	Arrgh	You're constructing a tuple that's instant garbage
2014-10-02 17:42:57	alexbobp	Arrgh: you can't do that though

2014-10-03 11:37:14	Maciej	ability to mix such a trait into case class is really helpful

2014-10-03 11:37:52	Maciej	so its better to always make case class because maybe you will want to do this

2014-10-03 11:40:03	S11001001	Maciej: because data composition is compositional and doesn't encourage violation of parametricity.  Mixins are not compositional.

2014-10-03 14:19:10	aarvar	"The problem with focusing relentlessly on understanding is that math and science students can often grasp essentials of an important idea, but this understanding can quickly slip away without consolidation through practice and repetition. Worse, students often believe they understand something when, in fact, they don’t. By championing the importance of understanding, teachers can inadvertently set their students up for failure as those
2014-10-03 14:19:25	wabash	Her point was not that it was universally true, but that it's probably a great thing to use as a teaching method. It may not be applicable to everyone.
2014-10-03 14:19:35	wabash	She's decrying the movement in teaching methodology.
2014-10-03 14:19:42	aarvar	and what do you do when you have a student which this doesn't apply to?

2014-10-08 19:02:33	karter	why is this showing an error ? z = "ABAB".toCharArray.toList; z.reduceLeft((a,b) => println (a.toString) )
2014-10-08 19:02:53	karter	the println specifically?
2014-10-08 19:04:42	OlegYch	which error?
2014-10-08 19:05:21	karter	<console>:10: error: type mismatch; - it says a is Unit which is puzzling
2014-10-08 19:05:23	patrickw	the function you are passing to reduceLeft doesn't have the right type, which is likely what the error says
2014-10-08 19:07:32	karter	i am passing println it operates on string - a and b are char
2014-10-08 19:07:59	patrickw	what is the return type of println, and what is the type you need to be returning
2014-10-08 19:08:20	--	timidtrap is now known as zzz_timidtrap
2014-10-08 19:08:30	OlegYch	perhaps you want foreach instead of reduceLeft

2014-10-08 19:09:33	karter	error: value length is not a member of Char

2014-10-11 12:52:37	edlinde	is it better to always use the Option method to raise exceptions?
2014-10-11 12:52:40	edlinde	or use throw?
2014-10-11 12:54:32	tpolecat	the common strategy is to use Option[A] for failure when you don't care about the cause, and Either[FailureType, A] when you do care about the cause
2014-10-11 12:54:59	tpolecat	scalaz has a type called \/ that is similar to Either but easier to use, so many people use that instead

2014-10-11 12:58:40	Guest80462	can somoene please explain how the _ gets the value of file ? http://scastie.org/6860
2014-10-11 12:58:53	edlinde	how do you catch the IO exceptions at a higher level?
2014-10-11 12:58:55	Guest80462	im new to scala - still trying to understand it 
2014-10-11 12:59:29	edlinde	tpolecat: the Option[A] and Either[FailureType, A] sounds very much like the Haskell  Maybe[A] and Either
2014-10-11 12:59:39	vixlur	its the same thing
2014-10-11 12:59:46	edlinde	ok
2014-10-11 13:00:02	tpolecat	Guest80462: in your case _.endsWith(query) is shorthand for the function literal (s: String) => s.endWith(query)
2014-10-11 13:00:14	tpolecat	the _ is interpreted as a parameter and its type is inferred

2014-10-11 13:01:59	edlinde	tpolecat: is there a good code sample for scala functional programs?
2014-10-11 13:02:30	tpolecat	as i said. instead of _.endsWith(query) write s => s.endsWith(query) or (s: String) => s.endsWith(query)
2014-10-11 13:02:34	edlinde	tpolecat: since I haven’t really coded any major projects in Haskell.. its also easier for me to see how larger projects are designed in scala
2014-10-11 13:02:53	edlinde	though I must admit that this whole thinking of things as objects vs everything being a fn is confusing
2014-10-11 13:03:00	tpolecat	edlinde: best way to learn that is http://manning.com/bjarnason/
2014-10-11 13:03:16	edlinde	yeah got that book
2014-10-11 13:03:42	Guest80462	for (file <- files; if file.matcher(query)) yield {file} - this fails 
2014-10-11 13:03:54	tpolecat	everything being a function isn't the point of FP. everything being a value is closer to the idea; functions relate values to other values
2014-10-11 13:04:01	Guest80462	so what is the long form of _,matcher  ? 
2014-10-11 13:04:29	edlinde	tpolecat: yeah but in scala this thing that you can also write stuff in an oo style screws with the whole FP thing in my head :)
2014-10-11 13:04:42	edlinde	I see some scala code that is so OO that it might as well have been written in Java
2014-10-11 13:05:10	tpolecat	yes, there are different style
2014-10-11 13:05:16	tpolecat	gotta run
2014-10-11 13:06:02	sorcer	edlinde: that is not functional then
2014-10-11 13:06:04	sorcer	edlinde: most likely
2014-10-11 13:06:11	sorcer	edlinde: scala allows you to do both, for good and for bad
2014-10-11 13:06:42	edlinde	yeah its just that I am going to be working on a project that uses scala.. but most programmer have this java background so they will tend to write thier stuff in OO style
2014-10-11 13:06:57	sorcer	Jup
2014-10-11 13:06:59	edlinde	which will introduce all the headaches that come with oo
2014-10-11 13:07:02	sorcer	That's pretty classic
2014-10-11 13:07:06	sorcer	exactly
2014-10-11 13:07:13	sorcer	then you are using scala as a nicer java
2014-10-11 13:07:25	edlinde	exactly and that is what I don’t want
2014-10-11 13:07:35	edlinde	I want it as purely FP as possible

2014-10-11 13:09:22	aarvar	it's just not very useful compared to typeclasses
2014-10-11 13:10:00	sorcer	using type classes for polymorphism and using your classes as only data types is very FP-style to me at least

2014-10-11 13:10:36	aarvar	FP just means no side effects though right

2014-10-12 15:49:38	tnks	some people settle on FP education in Scala because their team is really stuck on a JVM.

2014-10-13 14:27:05	kleemya	Found the solution. Odersky isn't actually describing a monad, but a so called Kleisli triple which is (speaking of the List example) the triple consisting of the List type constructor, the List(x) construtor and flatMap. You can prove that Kleisli triples are in fact equivalent to monads.

2014-10-13 15:45:03	tpolecat	newgary: there's a thing called wartermover, and i believe findbugs will work ok with scala since it just examines bytecode
2014-10-13 15:45:33	newgary	yeah am looking at findbugs, i lokoed briefly for source code analysis tools but i don't think there's alot of scala front ends
2014-10-13 15:45:40	newgary	so i was figuring anything that did java byte code would work
2014-10-13 15:45:41	newgary	what's mango?

2014-10-13 15:48:17	tpolecat	the point about flags is good. here's mine http://tpolecat.github.io/2014/04/11/scalac-flags.html 
2014-10-13 15:48:51	qu1j0t3	newgary: I suspect Scala actually obviates a lot of what Findbugs complains about (but not all of course)
2014-10-13 15:49:11	tpolecat	findbugs has some surprisingly advanced stuff actually
2014-10-13 15:49:16	newgary	awesome
2014-10-13 15:49:27	qu1j0t3	newgary: JPF is http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/intro/start
2014-10-13 15:49:46	tpolecat	i was reading http headers and then eventually writing some of them back out to the response and findbugs caught it and said it was a security problem
2014-10-13 15:49:52	tpolecat	i spit out some coffee 
2014-10-13 15:50:00	qu1j0t3	tpolecat: :)
2014-10-13 15:50:05	newgary	nice
2014-10-13 15:50:11	qu1j0t3	tpolecat: it's almost like computers can check static properties of shit!
2014-10-13 15:50:34	tpolecat	well that was really spread out, relative to the kinds of stuff linters tend to look at
2014-10-13 15:51:06	newgary	imho the problem with static analysis is the pages and pages of false positives :-(
2014-10-13 15:51:07	qu1j0t3	tpolecat: right. we use it at $WORK.
2014-10-13 15:51:16	tpolecat	but yeah scala allows you to make your types sufficiently precise to rule out a lot of things linters have traditionally done
2014-10-13 15:51:23	tpolecat	as quijibo noted
2014-10-13 15:51:25	qu1j0t3	newgary: well, that's not true in general
2014-10-13 15:51:36	qu1j0t3	newgary: it's not even true of findbugs; we just fix them all

2014-10-13 18:17:53	nmrp3	zamio, yes, but then I have to manage all the insert/remove logic manually, which I will do wrong
2014-10-13 18:18:11	nmrp3	d_m, yes :D A priority queue were priorities can match, and shouldn't clobber each-other if they do
2014-10-13 18:18:20	d_m	tpolecat: thanks! i was sort of taking an irc break for awhile
2014-10-13 18:18:22	nmrp3	I'm walking a graph
2014-10-13 18:18:28	d_m	nmrp3: it's mutable but take a look at this: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.mutable.PriorityQueue
2014-10-13 18:18:44	d_m	it might do what you want, if your items can be ordered according to their priority
2014-10-13 18:18:57	d_m	(you might want to insert (Score, Item) tuples if items don't know their own scores)
2014-10-13 18:19:03	d_m	that definitely won't lose "duplicates"
2014-10-13 18:19:29	nmrp3	d_m, I need immutable :( and I've tried to use that priority queue before with pairs like that but it's never really worked very well for me for some reason
2014-10-13 18:19:30	d_m	you'll need to provide an Ordering instance but that should be doable.

2014-10-13 18:21:44	d_m	it shouldn't be hard to implement a priority queue as an immutable tree (afaik anyway)
2014-10-13 18:21:46	nmrp3	oh I remember now - PriorityQueue uses the same ordering to decide how to order things by priority, and to decide if they are the same thing
2014-10-13 18:21:47	tpolecat	what's wrong with a priority queue of List[A]? you have to remove and reinsert each time, which adds a constant factor i guess
2014-10-13 18:21:57	d_m	you could even base it on a vector.
2014-10-13 18:22:09	d_m	tpolecat: so, i would say list is bad due to rebalancing concerns
2014-10-13 18:22:16	jmalicki	d_m: how could you base it on an immutable tree?!
2014-10-13 18:22:30	d_m	jmalicki: create a new tree when inserting or removing items
2014-10-13 18:22:32	jmalicki	d_m: and still get the same runtimes?
2014-10-13 18:22:42	jmalicki	d_m: hrmm yeah true
2014-10-13 18:22:42	nmrp3	jmalicki, lots of structure sharing
2014-10-13 18:22:45	d_m	use structural sharing. it would work like most other immutable structures
2014-10-13 18:22:46	tpolecat	well i was thinking a heap, so everything is log bn
2014-10-13 18:22:49	tpolecat	log n rather
2014-10-13 18:23:06	d_m	tpolecat: right but the standard heap algo often needs to put stuff at the "end"
2014-10-13 18:23:09	d_m	which is terrible for lists

2014-10-13 20:38:39	japhar81	in .net im using nancy (.net version of sinatra)
2014-10-13 20:38:57	japhar81	i have a loader that searches a folder for all dll's, reflects them all in, searching for a specific class attribute
2014-10-13 20:39:13	japhar81	that attribute is the base url, and i map that class as a controller

2014-10-13 20:39:26	japhar81	so i have a class called /users, and i map /api/users/* to that class when i find it
2014-10-13 20:39:38	japhar81	trying to do the same with (i guess?) a set of jar files in a plugins folder?
2014-10-13 20:39:46	japhar81	not really sure how this maps to scala-land
2014-10-13 20:39:49	japhar81	or java land for that matter
2014-10-13 20:40:04	doctau	japhar81: the standard java way of doing that is with a ServiceLoader, and META-INF/service/* files in the jars, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html

2014-10-13 20:42:07	doctau	japhar81: if you load each plugin into it's own classloader so they are isolated, you can also just require a well-known-name class of them
2014-10-13 20:42:23	japhar81	wait, that part didn't make as much sense
2014-10-13 20:42:33	doctau	japhar81: not unless you use classloaders and funny things like OSGi and Java EE containers do

2014-10-13 20:43:18	doctau	japhar81: I think .net has an equivalent but I don't know their name. if two plugins both have class a.b.C, what stops them conflicting?
2014-10-13 20:43:25	japhar81	appdomains
2014-10-13 20:43:34	japhar81	or, dll hell with strong signing and versions
2014-10-13 20:43:44	japhar81	but usually you seggregate with an app domain
2014-10-13 20:44:01	japhar81	so the nice thing in .net is if i point it at a folder, it will watch for updates/new files and auto-reload
2014-10-13 20:44:08	japhar81	is that where i need jboss or tomcat or something?
2014-10-13 20:44:23	japhar81	and wtf is OSGi? the wiki page makes no sense
2014-10-13 20:44:43	doctau	from what I find with google, classloaders correspond to the class isolation and some security parts of app domains, but not all of it
2014-10-13 20:45:05	tpolecat	you really don't want to be going down this road
2014-10-13 20:45:23	doctau	yeah, it can be a mess unless you really need to isolate the plugins

2014-10-13 20:49:08	tpolecat	i think the new way to do this is to stop trying to do all this dynamic shit. just stop your old program and run another one
2014-10-13 20:49:35	japhar81	well my problem is this is fronting an actor network, that could be in flight

2014-10-13 20:51:30	japhar81	although i suppose, if i can deploy multiple war files to tomcat, and have the backend actors still talk to these front ends, that might work
2014-10-13 20:51:32	tpolecat	japhar81: this is beyond my immediate experience so i will bow out. you will be biting off a lot of complexity to accomplish this so consider whether it's really needed
2014-10-13 20:51:45	japhar81	tpolecat: totally not needed, learning excercise
2014-10-13 20:51:49	doctau	a lot of the issues around that aren't really java/jvm/scala specific

2014-10-13 20:53:55	wabash	I have a trait, and a group of classes that extend it. (so they all got something in common).   I want to write methods that implicitly convert each class to say,,, class X.   Now, for hierachy polymorph, I'd just make each one have a toX method.  But I can also have them all implicityl converted to X with an implicit method.
2014-10-13 20:54:14	doctau	japhar81: what we advise people at work is start a new parallel cluster with the new stuff and send new traffic to it
2014-10-13 20:54:15	wabash	So, say I make a converter object, and it defines all the conversion methods.
2014-10-13 20:54:27	doctau	when you have no old traffic left, turn off the old cluster :)
2014-10-13 20:54:37	japhar81	so how do you swing long-running work?
2014-10-13 20:54:39	wabash	Is it better to name each method somthing like "convertAtoX" and "convertBtoX", etc? 
2014-10-13 20:54:45	japhar81	or do you just point both clusters to the same database?
2014-10-13 20:54:50	wabash	Or can I overload them all since each one takes a different type?
2014-10-13 20:54:52	japhar81	and if so, what happens to duplicated actors?
2014-10-13 20:55:04	doctau	japhar81: it depends on the details of the work (and that probably isn't jvm/.net specific) - how do you do it in .net?
2014-10-13 20:55:17	wabash	"convertToX(a: A)",   "convertToX(b: B)". etc.
2014-10-13 20:55:20	wabash	what's the right way to do this?
2014-10-13 20:55:24	WiteCollrScalar	wabash: perhaps use type classes and enhance your existing classes instead of adding convertToX
2014-10-13 20:55:24	japhar81	well, our actors are stateful in .net, so we persist state at every transaction
2014-10-13 20:55:34	japhar81	swinging load means we kill the old actor, start it elsewhere, and it loads state
2014-10-13 20:55:35	doctau	wabash: sounds like you want a typeclass
2014-10-13 20:55:45	wabash	WiteCollrScalar: Indeed, though I'm talking about implicit conversions. Does that fall under typeclass?
2014-10-13 20:55:50	japhar81	so the backend just scales and fails over that way
2014-10-13 20:56:00	wabash	IOW, I will *not* have a "toX" method anymore.
2014-10-13 20:56:00	japhar81	but the front end, i built a bunch of scaffolding around to do the same thing

2014-10-19 19:34:34	wabash	Not sure why any of this was complex.
2014-10-19 19:34:40	qu1j0t3	wabash: it's why Scala is called interoperable with Java APIs.
2014-10-19 19:34:45	qu1j0t3	wabash: it's transparent...

2014-10-19 19:35:19	qu1j0t3	there are no 'java' classes and 'scala' classes.
2014-10-19 19:35:22	wabash	Of this particular fact though, I'm totally ignorant!
2014-10-19 19:35:26	qu1j0t3	ok.
2014-10-19 19:35:56	OlegYch7	qu1j0t3: in fact there are java classes and scala classes
2014-10-19 19:35:57	qu1j0t3	well, that's what interoperability is about. You don't have to care (much) what you're calling. There are dark corners, though, which are well covered in "Scala in Depth". I've never hit one.
2014-10-19 19:35:57	wabash	If you have a java lib, with a java api, and you call a no-arg method in java, it looks like m().  If you do the same lib and method from scala, can you just say m with no parens?
2014-10-19 19:36:22	qu1j0t3	OlegYch7: Any hair can be split down to atoms.

2014-10-19 21:34:09	farmerworking	japhar81: So do you come up a way to structure compare map?

2014-10-19 21:38:15	aarvar	that isnt pattern matching on a map
2014-10-19 21:38:22	aarvar	that's pattern matching on a tuple

2014-10-19 21:45:28	farmerworking	the solution is wired to me
2014-10-19 21:45:56	qu1j0t3	it's not unification, so you can't put a constraint in the pattern
2014-10-19 21:46:13	qu1j0t3	you can put constants though
2014-10-19 21:46:29	qu1j0t3	but again, it won't SEARCH for you. it can only match the value given

2014-10-19 21:47:23	farmerworking	qu1j0t3: What I really want is to compare two graphic. map is just an convenient way to represent it
2014-10-19 21:47:52	qu1j0t3	is your example accurate? Why would you be comparing a key and a value?
2014-10-19 21:49:02	farmerworking	think Map(1 -> 2, 2 -> 1) like a graphic where there are two node A, B
2014-10-19 21:49:11	farmerworking	A point to B and B point to A
2014-10-19 21:49:47	qu1j0t3	well, that's a search, then. you can't use match alone
2014-10-19 21:49:49	farmerworking	So the essential is the same for Map(3 -> 4, 4 -> 3) or Map (100 -> 99, 99 -> 100)
2014-10-19 21:50:32	farmerworking	But image. If I can do: case Map(a -> b, c -> d) if b == c and d == a => true 
2014-10-19 21:50:42	qu1j0t3	you can't, as you've been told.
2014-10-19 21:50:47	qu1j0t3	it's not unification or search.
2014-10-19 21:50:51	aarvar	well, you can if you convert to a list..
2014-10-19 21:50:55	qu1j0t3	you can however still solve it.
2014-10-19 21:50:58	aarvar	but it will only work for maps of length 2 then
2014-10-19 21:51:10	qu1j0t3	yes, you can do it for maps of length 2
2014-10-19 21:51:16	qu1j0t3	which may be all that's wanted

2014-10-19 22:41:48	OlegYch7	at the very least there is json4s which is basically lift-json with fixes
2014-10-19 22:42:05	nocturne777	spray-json 1.30 is pretty good
2014-10-19 22:42:43	OlegYch7	then there is play-json which is quite common and doesn't use reflection, and argonaut which is probably better designed
2014-10-19 22:43:08	OlegYch7	spray-json is pretty terribly designed and afaik is pretty slow
2014-10-19 22:43:23	nocturne777	OlegYch7: 1.3.0 not slow actually
2014-10-19 22:44:26	nocturne777	I don't understand why one would use argonaut. Its API looks too busy for a JSON library
2014-10-19 22:46:00	qu1j0t3	it works pretty well.

2014-10-19 23:50:51	zacharypch	then i come to find out it doesn't do at all what i expect, the entire query has to materialize and then turn into a scala stream, defeating the purpose there
2014-10-19 23:51:17	zacharypch	so i finally get this query going that chews through a few million records and makes a little model about it
2014-10-19 23:51:34	zacharypch	.par, using grouping i think makes sense, and it consumes a few thousand records a second
2014-10-19 23:51:49	zacharypch	had to abandon it and just write a 10 line sql query...solved the problem in about 8 minutes
2014-10-19 23:52:05	zacharypch	so i've come to think that slick is totally useless for anything other than simple inserting
2014-10-19 23:52:14	zacharypch	really hoping to be talked down here

2014-10-19 23:53:19	Milyardo	So what you're saying is I should drop hibernate for slick on a feature I merging mainline into my companies product on Wednesday?
2014-10-19 23:53:21	Milyardo	I'm sold
2014-10-19 23:53:38	d_m	zacharypch: that sounds pretty bad :/ i haven't used slick at all.
2014-10-19 23:53:43	zacharypch	i mean i think slick is great for defining tables, and inserting simple data into them.  
2014-10-19 23:54:03	zacharypch	also actually the direct sql string interpolation is great for sql queries
2014-10-19 23:54:16	zacharypch	so you can map a sql query into scala types.
2014-10-19 23:54:30	zacharypch	but the magic it tries to do for making sql disappear is not worth it
2014-10-19 23:54:59	zacharypch	and today i had to write an implicit thing that implemented mapping from postgres arrays to scala arrays
2014-10-19 23:55:34	zacharypch	since the getArray call in jdbc is not implemented..,my reco is just never use the slick lifted embedding for querying
2014-10-19 23:55:42	zacharypch	it's so much effort to avoid learning sql
2014-10-19 23:55:50	zacharypch	and the result is totally worthless
2014-10-19 23:56:10	zacharypch	wow i'm feeling a lot better kind of

2014-10-20 00:01:39	zacharypch	yeah in my experience the iterator().grouped.par pattern that i came to was just so slow, i was thinking that people must be using direct sql queries for meaningful selects, or else i'm missing something
2014-10-20 00:01:56	Milyardo	I working on doing full text search in postgres, was thinking about trying out slick for the project, but never found the time to try it, now I'm suck doing queries via em.createNativeQuery
2014-10-20 00:02:02	Milyardo	it's own kind of hell
2014-10-20 00:03:00	qu1j0t3	zacharypch: I was using the lifted syntax everywhere. I appreciated the type checking because I was changing the model from time to time (it was a new project, not an established one)
2014-10-20 00:03:59	zacharypch	yea the type checking is great, but you kind of get that with the sql interpolation too,  the sql"select * blah blah".as[(scala type tuple thing here)], but you're right, it's a runtime error if that query doesn't return what you want
2014-10-20 00:04:02	zacharypch	totally agree on that

2014-10-20 00:06:43	zacharypch	i guess so, but you can really invest a lot of time going down that path before you reach the level of complexity it's not good with
2014-10-20 00:06:45	qu1j0t3	zacharypch: I also used the query composition feature, at least once. When that works out, it's really nice.

2014-10-20 22:44:04	aarvar	it's the book the wikipedia page sites
2014-10-20 22:44:10	aarvar	too lazy to
2014-10-20 22:44:24	aarvar	someone explain how you can have typeclasses without types please
2014-10-20 22:44:25	mdedetrich	well thats your problem
2014-10-20 22:44:29	aarvar	indeed
2014-10-20 22:44:59	aarvar	anyway, immutable values?
2014-10-20 22:45:04	mdedetrich	you can watch one of his videos
2014-10-20 22:45:07	aarvar	does haskell really have anything to do with immutable values?
2014-10-20 22:45:09	mdedetrich	he explains it there
2014-10-20 22:45:18	mdedetrich	pretty sure your too lazy for that as well
2014-10-20 22:45:24	aarvar	*you're

2014-10-20 22:49:48	deuteros__	"Best features" of a language is certainly subjective

2014-10-20 22:50:27	mdedetrich	you are
2014-10-20 22:50:57	aarvar	anyway, I was saying that haskell's best feature(s) is its type system
2014-10-20 22:51:04	aarvar	haskell obviously has a good type system
2014-10-20 22:51:10	mdedetrich	which is your subjective opinion

2014-10-20 22:51:38	OlegYch5	doh i must have steered  a great pile of shit
2014-10-20 22:51:43	aarvar	the only other one you could argue for is non-strictness by default

2014-10-20 22:52:06	aarvar	you realize that's just a result of the type system right?
2014-10-20 22:52:14	aarvar	it has an expressive type system
2014-10-20 22:52:50	aarvar	unless you can have purity without types?
2014-10-20 22:52:54	mdedetrich	ruby is expressive, and it doesn't have a real type system
2014-10-20 22:52:59	aarvar	lol
2014-10-20 22:53:01	mdedetrich	expressivness has nothing to do with types
2014-10-20 22:53:04	aarvar	lol

2014-10-20 23:01:28	aarvar	java is inexpressive

2014-10-20 23:01:29	mdedetrich	types contribute to correctness, not readability
2014-10-20 23:01:30	tnks	haskell's inference and syntax help a lot.
2014-10-20 23:01:37	qu1j0t3	aarvar: Scheme encourages it

2014-10-20 23:03:29	mdedetrich	again, enforcing has to do with correctness as well

2014-10-20 23:04:38	tnks	deuteros__: that article is a bit trolling, and was discussed at length when it came out
2014-10-20 23:04:46	aarvar	all haskell code is pure unless you use unsafe features
2014-10-20 23:04:47	deuteros__	tnks: Agreed
2014-10-20 23:04:52	deuteros__	tnks: Interesting nevertheless
2014-10-20 23:05:10	deuteros__	Harper's agenda is well known but he's still one hell of a smart scientist
2014-10-20 23:05:15	aarvar	and yes, haskell has unsafe features
2014-10-20 23:05:20	aarvar	but they're understood as unsafe
2014-10-20 23:05:51	deuteros__	I don't find the unsafe thing very convincing anyway, we've been writing working programs in unsafe languages for decades
2014-10-20 23:05:52	aarvar	and they actually are unsafe because the compiler optimizes as if they don't exist, at least in the case of unsafePerformIO

2014-10-26 13:30:07	japhar81	so how does java/scala handle authorization? my old stand-by of querying AD isn't gonna make much sense.. It's easy enough to do the authentication, but what about rights grants and group hierarchies of rights? roll my own? is there something available?

I am mostly interested in web development. Scala runs on JVM and apparently that's faster than even node (if done right). 
2014-10-28 20:50:12	mdedetrich	ziikutv: scala is the C++ of high level languages, so take that as you will
2014-10-28 20:50:35	mdedetrich	ziikutv: golang is a completely pragmatic language, its essentially C + CSP + package manager + structural typing

2014-10-28 20:55:47	aarvar	if you cant even write something like Functor then you're just asking to have to repeat logic

2014-10-28 20:58:25	aarvar	I dont? then how do I avoid repeating that logic?
2014-10-28 20:58:25	tixxit	ziikutv: Yeah - Well, Scala taught me a lot about functional programming. I wished I had learned more about it earlier
2014-10-28 20:58:34	tixxit	back when I was in school ;)
2014-10-28 20:58:38	OlegYch	ziikutv: i wouldn't recommend going node path, scala can do the same and more
2014-10-28 20:59:30	mdedetrich	aarvar: and if you are wondering, Go puts more emphasis on readability than being DRY
2014-10-28 20:59:32	ziikutv	Yea but it seems there is a lot more leg work here. 
2014-10-28 20:59:43	aarvar	"readability"
2014-10-28 20:59:55	aarvar	DRY is necessary for readability
2014-10-28 21:00:02	ziikutv	tixxit: perhaps I should get dirty with Scala first before I think of web development with it. What are some resources you found useful? Books? 
2014-10-28 21:00:05	aarvar	otherwise you're wasting your time reading the same code over and over
2014-10-28 21:00:21	mdedetrich	aarvar: maybe you should understand why google created go
2014-10-28 21:00:24	ziikutv	aarvar: I dont think re-reading is the main reason for DRY.
2014-10-28 21:00:29	aarvar	the fact is that go doesnt enable a high level of abstraction
2014-10-28 21:00:36	aarvar	sure, it's part of it

2014-10-28 21:00:48	aarvar	if most code shares the same abstractions then it's easier to understand
2014-10-28 21:00:55	aarvar	since you can already be familiar with those abstractions
2014-10-28 21:01:03	ziikutv	p.s: in a recent talk/hangout google people said they mostly use go as a tool-creation language.

2014-10-28 21:01:38	mdedetrich	node.js has a distinct advantage over scala in the sense that everything in node.js is evented, where as its not in scala, which means you are going to wrap stuff in task/future all of the time
2014-10-28 21:01:58	aarvar	lol what?
2014-10-28 21:02:01	tnks	I argue against DRY in some instances. . . when an idea is not really figured out, and there's good reason to allow it to be copied for intentional mutation.

2014-10-28 21:02:56	mdedetrich	go is basically replacing a lot of the areas where java was used, backend server code
2014-10-28 21:03:11	aarvar	well, java cant express Functor either
2014-10-28 21:03:12	mdedetrich	its actually the same area where scala has its strenght, but Google picked and made go, for a specific reason
2014-10-28 21:03:14	ziikutv	OlegYch: So should I just do web development from get go or should I do some other stuff and learn scala first :P
2014-10-28 21:03:18	mdedetrich	over scala
2014-10-28 21:03:40	aarvar	you should learn haskell first

2014-10-28 21:29:47	tnks	mdedetrich: it doesn't matter.
2014-10-28 21:29:52	aarvar	so when you say haskell isnt popular, that just means that it isnt popular
2014-10-28 21:29:52	tnks	people said that about COBOL>
2014-10-28 21:29:56	tnks	and they were right.
2014-10-28 21:29:59	qu1j0t3	aarvar: learning is bad mmmkay!
2014-10-28 21:30:00	ziikutv	tnks: So hyou are saying i shouldnt learn scala
2014-10-28 21:30:07	tnks	but there's not real payoff to "betting on COBOL"
2014-10-28 21:30:12	tnks	it's completely uninteresting.
2014-10-28 21:30:12	aarvar	no, you  should learn scala
2014-10-28 21:30:21	ziikutv	aarvar: why
2014-10-28 21:30:22	aarvar	but it might be easier to learn haskell first, in the long term
2014-10-28 21:30:24	tnks	just learn the language that gives you the most value.
2014-10-28 21:30:44	aarvar	why? because scala supports superior abstractions
2014-10-28 21:30:47	tnks	and practice the ecosystem you have to for whatever circumstantial constraint.
2014-10-28 21:30:52	mdedetrich	COBOL dies because better stuff came along, I have no idea how thats relevant
2014-10-28 21:31:06	tnks	mdedetrich: COBOL lasted for a long, long time.
2014-10-28 21:31:12	tnks	as has FORTRAN.
2014-10-28 21:31:16	mdedetrich	my point is simply, if you want good library support with a big ecosystem, Haskell is not going to be a language that will achieve that
2014-10-28 21:31:21	ziikutv	tnks: Well it seems like everytime i go on my laptop i hear of a new fucking language (at least its new to me) and it confuses me to drop what im doing and to learn that, then I hear about something else.. and I dont know wtf to do
2014-10-28 21:31:23	tnks	mdedetrich: it already has.
2014-10-28 21:31:27	tnks	it's just not complete.
2014-10-28 21:31:33	tnks	for a couple of databases.
2014-10-28 21:31:37	mdedetrich	tnks: yes, because they are used in finance sectors that can't upgrade
2014-10-28 21:31:39	tnks	and some distributed computation.
2014-10-28 21:31:40	ziikutv	just learned about "ocaml"
2014-10-28 21:31:40	aarvar	indeed, there are too many new languages that dont offer any real benefits
2014-10-28 21:31:44	qu1j0t3	ziikutv: Scala's been around since 2003, and Haskell considerably longer than that.
2014-10-28 21:31:46	mdedetrich	tnks: thats a paradox
2014-10-28 21:31:55	tnks	mdedetrich: I have no idea why you keep on coming to the idea that Haskell is only used in finance.
2014-10-28 21:32:00	tnks	there's a lot of new shops picking it up,

2014-10-28 21:32:06	aarvar	mdedetrich: do you know haskell?
2014-10-28 21:32:19	mdedetrich	the whole point of an ecosystem is that is has to be "complete". If you are arguing that the language's ecosystem is not complete, then by definition it doesn't have a real ecosystem

2014-10-28 21:32:24	aarvar	if you know anything about haskell there's no way you can conclude these things
2014-10-28 21:32:27	mdedetrich	aarvar: I used it like 5 years ago, then moved on
2014-10-28 21:32:29	tnks	mdedetrich: this is rediculous.
2014-10-28 21:32:31	qu1j0t3	tnks: the other day somebody asserted it's NEVER used in finance ;-) Can't the trolls get their facts straight?!
2014-10-28 21:32:53	tnks	mdedetrich: Node has none of the "library support" you're talking about, but it will succeed for another reason.
2014-10-28 21:32:59	mdedetrich	I also studied it in uni
2014-10-28 21:33:00	aarvar	everyone knows that inconsistent claims are harder to refute!!
2014-10-28 21:33:04	tnks	languages survive for all kinds of weird reasons.
2014-10-28 21:33:13	mdedetrich	I am not talking about surviving
2014-10-28 21:33:13	tnks	Haskell is usable, and will only get better
2014-10-28 21:33:16	mdedetrich	or popularity
2014-10-28 21:33:23	mdedetrich	I am talking about ecosystem support
2014-10-28 21:33:27	aarvar	that's another thing, haskell has continued to improve
2014-10-28 21:33:27	tnks	mdedetrich: I suspect you know very little about Haskell libraries.
2014-10-28 21:33:32	tnks	and have not made serious applications in it.
2014-10-28 21:33:37	tnks	and are kind of speaking from hearsay.
2014-10-28 21:33:47	mdedetrich	I moved away from Haskell because of its "libraries"
2014-10-28 21:33:54	ziikutv	So wtf do i do..
2014-10-28 21:34:01	ziikutv	should i like get off the fucking net or something?
2014-10-28 21:34:03	mdedetrich	ziikutv: learn scala, learn play
2014-10-28 21:34:05	tnks	mdedetrich: I'll agree that there's some holes -- it's not at all irreparable.
2014-10-28 21:34:08	aarvar	you can learn scala, or learn haskell
2014-10-28 21:34:09	qu1j0t3	ziikutv: go right ahead and learn Scala. It's widely used in production. By Twitter, for example.
2014-10-28 21:34:11	tnks	and Java's libraries are pretty terrible.
2014-10-28 21:34:17	aarvar	both routes have their pros and cons
2014-10-28 21:34:27	tnks	I just now had to switch from scalaz-stream to Java's filesystem.
2014-10-28 21:34:36	tnks	and deal with API's "designed" to take nulls.
2014-10-28 21:34:41	mdedetrich	tnks: right, and because it has holes, its basically worse off, in regards to its ecosystem, compared to its competitors
2014-10-28 21:34:45	mdedetrich	so admit that
2014-10-28 21:34:46	mdedetrich	and move on
2014-10-28 21:34:52	mdedetrich	stop being so defensive about Haskell
2014-10-28 21:34:56	deuteros	I disagree, I think most of the Java collections are quite good, at least for Java
2014-10-28 21:34:56	aarvar	lol
2014-10-28 21:34:57	tnks	mdedetrich: so we use it where we can.
2014-10-28 21:35:00	qu1j0t3	ziikutv: but Haskell will also open up pretty wide vistas. None of the other 'new' languages are very interesting pedagogically
2014-10-28 21:35:00	mdedetrich	every language has its qwerks
2014-10-28 21:35:05	tnks	but it's hugely important for teaching.

2014-10-28 21:35:15	deuteros	If anything, Scala’s standard library is receiving a lot more hate than Java’s library
2014-10-28 21:35:17	aarvar	no one said haskell is perfect
2014-10-28 21:35:21	tnks	mdedetrich: we're using it. . . in production.
2014-10-28 21:35:25	aarvar	haskell has flaws as well

2014-10-30 22:54:30	mdedetrich	Loof: an execution context is exactly what it states, its a variable that defines how to execute abstract tasks (i.e. futures/scalaz tasks, parallel collections)
2014-10-30 22:54:45	OlegYch	i mean if it's consuming chunks coming from netty and not blocking in the process there is no reason to offload the work
2014-10-30 22:54:47	Loof	OlegYch: Yes, I'm executing blocking code
2014-10-30 22:55:01	mdedetrich	Loof: if you are dealing with Futures, any kind of operation on Futures requires an implicit EC
2014-10-30 22:55:24	mdedetrich	Loof: so if you want to only run a Future, or a set of Futures on a single thread, you create your own EC, set the thread pool to one
2014-10-30 22:55:27	Loof	I've tried a number of things... This is in a BodyParser for Scala
2014-10-30 22:55:35	mdedetrich	Loof: and then pass it explicitly
2014-10-30 22:55:43	Loof	My understanding is that an Iteratee is able to run in it's own thread
2014-10-30 22:55:50	Loof	I just don't understand HOW
2014-10-30 22:55:58	OlegYch	well you would need a separate context to execute blocking code
2014-10-30 22:56:23	Loof	The stuff I see in the code does things like 'import ...internalContext' but that's a private (and fairly complex) object
2014-10-30 22:56:37	OlegYch	global context and wrapping in "blocking" should be good enough
2014-10-30 22:56:45	Loof	I've read various examples...
2014-10-30 22:57:25	Loof	OlegYch: I -think- what is happening is that I'm in a play Iteratee...  and looking at the code, it sets a default ec of trampoline.
2014-10-30 22:57:32	Loof	That makes it execute in the same thread
2014-10-30 22:57:51	Loof	the only othe examples I found import a different ec into the bodyparser...but those don't work outside of the class
2014-10-30 22:57:54	Loof	I'm utterly lost :)

2014-10-30 23:08:17	Loof	All of the play examples use Future

2014-10-30 23:09:50	OlegYch	but most of the time using scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global to create a Future which makes a blocking call and wrapping that call in blocking should be alright

2014-10-30 23:12:05	Loof	That's more like it... I'm still blocking for some reason

2014-10-30 23:18:29	Loof	what's the difference between future {} and Future {}?
2014-10-30 23:18:57	OlegYch	you need to wrap the stuff that runs in the Future (on the ec that supports blocking)

2014-10-31 22:45:03	bofh	heh, when I've been trying to solve some problems on projecteuler with strict FP in Haskell, sometimes I wanted to give up and code that shit in C or Java
2014-10-31 22:45:40	bofh	fp is not natural for an average programmer, who had spent years on imperative languages
2014-10-31 22:46:00	therealGent	I hear this is a good way to program concurrently.
2014-10-31 22:46:01	bofh	probably its easier to grasp it when you're a student

2014-10-31 22:46:47	aarvar	why do you need unsafePerformIO

2014-10-31 22:47:16	aarvar	huh
2014-10-31 22:47:34	bofh	otherwise you don't know how your expressions would be evaluated, if ever.

2014-10-31 22:49:12	therealGent	i think im going to do just that :)
2014-10-31 22:49:24	bofh	anyway, haskell or scala will give you awesome satisfaction when you solve something really complex in a pure functional way

2014-10-31 22:54:03	bofh	heh, to use do in haskell you have to deal with monad and 2 functions, in Scala there're filter/map/flatMap and something else, afair
2014-10-31 22:54:29	bofh	and you may not have some of the functions defined, which brings even more fun
2014-10-31 22:54:30	aarvar	haskell also has list comprehensions
2014-10-31 22:54:43	bofh	I'm not talking about comprehensions
2014-10-31 22:55:00	aarvar	they're called for *comprehensions* for a reason

2014-10-31 22:55:38	bofh	whatever

2014-10-31 23:17:06	aarvar	you probably dont want to match against sets
2014-10-31 23:17:46	therealGent	why? It's the best way I can reason about this. Duplicates in this context are redundant and need to be stripped.

2014-10-31 23:43:45	Lymia	Given A -> B, C -> D, and A as input, you want ["A", "B"] since C and D can't be made from justA

2014-10-31 23:43:58	therealGent	That's right.

2014-10-31 23:44:06	Lymia	The solution I posted doesn't quite work still.
2014-10-31 23:44:13	Lymia	It fails if you give it A and "B -> C, A -> B"
2014-10-31 23:44:18	Lymia	Since it needs to do two passes for that.
2014-10-31 23:44:22	therealGent	Right.
2014-10-31 23:44:28	Lymia	But, key thing is:
2014-10-31 23:44:36	Lymia	lhs & currentClosure == lhs
2014-10-31 23:44:48	Lymia	I'm not sure this is the best way to do it, but, this does check that currentClosure contains everything in lhs
2014-10-31 23:45:00	Lymia	At this point, it's just an if/else operation:

2014-10-31 23:46:50	miaoski	G'day.  I'm reading "Scala for the Impatient" and got confused by the language design.  Why does Scala decide not to include "reading binary files" and "writing files" into part of it IO library?

2014-10-31 23:47:11	Lymia	Interesting.
2014-10-31 23:47:22	reactormonk	miaoski, reading files is via io.Source, writing files is Java API.
2014-10-31 23:47:39	miaoski	reactormonk: if that's it, why bother have scala.io.Source ...
2014-10-31 23:48:06	aarvar	well, it works at least
2014-10-31 23:48:11	reactormonk	miaoski, you don't have everything from the stdlib in the default namespace, e.g. mutable collections

2014-10-31 23:48:56	Lymia	Still needs to be passed through the fixed point combinator
2014-10-31 23:49:02	Lymia	Does Scala have that built-in?
2014-10-31 23:49:06	reactormonk	miaoski, I'd guess you'll have to do some historian's work and dig through old mailing lists :-)

2014-10-31 23:49:39	Lymia	therealGent, anyway
2014-10-31 23:49:46	aarvar	but yeah, you have to repeat that method until you get the same result
2014-10-31 23:49:54	Lymia	(lhs & currentClosure) == lhs is basically the same bit hack you see for bitfields
2014-10-31 23:50:27	Lymia	Not the most elegant, but, it would work.

2014-10-31 23:54:23	mdedetrich	reactormonk: what do you mean by, does sbt use sll?
2014-10-31 23:54:46	reactormonk	mdedetrich, debugging why sbt doesn't find the dependency.
2014-10-31 23:54:54	therealGent	Lymia, any pros and cons to using one or the other? why do i keep hearing that FP takes advantage of multiple cores better and is better for highly concurrent coding?
2014-10-31 23:55:30	reactormonk	therealGent, because you have the principle of no side effecets which allows for parallelization without having to care too much
2014-10-31 23:55:32	aarvar	because side effects are problematic in non-sequential code?
2014-10-31 23:55:38	Lymia	You get easier to reason with code, since you don't have shared mutable state flying everywhere.
2014-10-31 23:55:40	mdedetrich	reactormonk: https://gist.github.com/mdedetrich/916b1a131e86077f12f9

2014-10-31 23:56:03	Lymia	For concurrency, that's very very helpful because.. well... you know how hard synchronization is, right?
2014-10-31 23:56:12	therealGent	I'm a bit familiar yes.

2014-10-31 23:56:53	Lymia	f is assumed to have no side effects, so there's no need to run f on the elements of list in any particular order.
2014-10-31 23:56:56	aarvar	if you dont have side effects then evaluation order doesnt matter (ignoring non-totality)
2014-10-31 23:57:17	reactormonk	mdedetrich, ok, apparently that should do

2014-10-31 23:57:25	therealGent	does map automatically create threads for that kind of operation?

2014-11-02 14:50:40	tpolecat	so instead of having a method call nextAddr() or whatever, it would take a Stream[Address] as an argument, and return the rest of the stream as part of its result

What I'm trying to accomplish is to have one method build that takes a bunch of arguments and then a

2014-11-02 16:56:51	qu1j0t3	calleerlandsson: so every argument to createUser is an A=>A. In Scala, varargs produce a single Seq parameter, so your next step would be to reduce all these using a monoid, or, you could use a fold, probably
2014-11-02 16:57:25	qu1j0t3	calleerlandsson: it could be defined anywhere you like. it's just a function String => User => User

2014-11-02 17:10:03	qu1j0t3	yes they could collide if you wanted to use them in the same scope. However you could always modify the import to give each a short, unique prefix

2014-11-02 17:13:03	qu1j0t3	having a bunch of overlapping fields might raise a "normalisation" question

2014-11-02 18:17:10	wabash	I see the problem.
2014-11-02 18:17:13	wabash	It's commented out.
2014-11-02 18:17:28	japhar81	yeah, i stuck the string in in its place
2014-11-02 18:17:41	japhar81	i have the distinct feeling that the getReader stuff is somehow distructive
2014-11-02 18:17:46	adelbertc	Something something argonaut
2014-11-02 18:18:03	japhar81	sadly making argonaut play with scalatra is not going to work
2014-11-02 18:18:10	japhar81	they're too married to json4s on everything
2014-11-02 18:18:44	japhar81	so i was under the impression that if i did a val, it was set once and forever
2014-11-02 18:18:47	japhar81	is that incorrect?

2014-11-02 18:20:24	japhar81	im pretty sure my problem is that's getting run more than once and the second time, the reader is already at EOF

2014-11-02 18:21:43	tpolecat	and if it's a def then it will get re-evaluated each time you call it
2014-11-02 18:22:16	tpolecat	oh i see. good times

2014-11-02 18:23:53	tpolecat	performing a side-effect on construction isn't a good idea, as a general rule
2014-11-02 18:24:06	tpolecat	why not ensure that the input is consumed only and exactly where needed?

2014-11-02 18:24:38	japhar81	the problem is it's needed twice
2014-11-02 18:25:17	japhar81	moving to the constructor was my attempt to have it only run once and be re-used
2014-11-02 18:25:23	japhar81	but i guess they're instancing the class twice
2014-11-02 18:25:29	tpolecat	maybe they don't expect you to examine the body at this point
2014-11-02 18:25:47	tpolecat	who knows, scalatra gives me the heebiejeebies
2014-11-02 18:27:09	japhar81	yeah, its starting to get on my nerves too
2014-11-02 18:27:41	japhar81	what else is out there that plays nice with atmosphere? i ruled play out as too much MVC cruft I'll never use
2014-11-02 18:28:22	japhar81	and hopefully has better documentation

Once you construct your query, you can call .selectStatement or .insertStatement and then println() it to see for yourself how convenient this is.

2014-11-03 22:03:11	wabash	QF-MichaelK: If you do joins (which I hope you do), you can filter each TableQuery object before you join. Looking at the generated SQL, and doing a 'explain' on it, you'll see the the filtering is done before the join as subqueries. So   userQuery.filter(_.name === "Michael").join(bookQuery).on{ case (u, b) => u.id === b.userId}
2014-11-03 22:03:22	wabash	will filter for Michael before doing the join, and you get nice efficient sql.

2014-11-03 22:05:14	wabash	Ok, that's all. Documentations sucks. ask me "school of hard knocks" questions.

2014-11-04 20:57:03	mdedetrich	jok: Ill be more accurate, Scala is kinda the C++ of high level languages
2014-11-04 20:57:10	mdedetrich	it does a lot of stuff, and mixes a lot of concepts/paradigms
2014-11-04 20:57:21	mdedetrich	so learning/using Scala is a long term goal
2014-11-04 20:57:30	aarvar	yeah, there are soooo many paradigms
2014-11-04 20:57:43	mdedetrich	its worth it, but it takes time
2014-11-04 20:57:46	mdedetrich	also, ignore aarvar 
2014-11-04 20:59:20	mdedetrich	jok: think of it this way, Scala tries to be as expressive as ruby, while trying to statically verify your program (while also allowing functional style programming)

2014-11-04 21:02:10	OlegYch	that's called trolling, mate
2014-11-04 21:02:12	sgronblo	with "easy languages" the initial creation is easy but making sure your program actually works and maintaining it becomes hard
2014-11-04 21:02:23	mdedetrich	sgronblo: yeah exactly
2014-11-04 21:02:25	sgronblo	then again, I feel like Scala is too complicated for its own good.
2014-11-04 21:02:28	aarvar	how is the initial creation easy?
2014-11-04 21:03:00	jok	Whats the difference between servlet and netty 
2014-11-04 21:03:02	mdedetrich	sgronblo: well its getting better over time

2014-11-04 21:03:27	aarvar	if scala is too complicated then what would you take out
2014-11-04 21:03:30	sgronblo	"the initial creation" being finishing writing your program in your editor and you delude yourself it is good enough to run
2014-11-04 21:03:55	aarvar	but you can write a program in an editor just as fast in a statically typed language?
2014-11-04 21:04:01	jok	I am seeing all these benchmarks where scala is doing well but not sure if discussion here of that is allowed

2014-11-04 21:06:05	OlegYch	haha every sucessfull trolling is indistinguishable from benchmarking
2014-11-04 21:06:06	sgronblo	pdxleif: yeah Ruby is actually really complicated too
2014-11-04 21:06:09	aarvar	I don't understand how they get to that conclusion though
2014-11-04 21:06:09	OlegYch	or so they say
2014-11-04 21:06:17	mdedetrich	pdxleif: ruby's issue honestly, is that its both dynamically typed and emphasises heavy subclassing
2014-11-04 21:06:35	mdedetrich	pdxleif: which means you get massive object heirarchies, then mix that with mixins and monkey patching
2014-11-04 21:06:36	sgronblo	easiest language = Python
2014-11-04 21:06:39	mdedetrich	and it becomes hard to reason

2014-11-04 21:07:04	mdedetrich	on the other hand, if you code in something like clojure, its fairly easy to reason about even though its dynamically typed

2014-11-04 21:07:16	sgronblo	aarvar: thats only true for some weird definition of easy
2014-11-04 21:07:17	pdxleif	mdedetrich: People do that kind of thing in scala too, w/ large object heirarchies, and mixins and such
2014-11-04 21:07:21	pdxleif	no monkey patching, at least
2014-11-04 21:07:22	aarvar	define easy
2014-11-04 21:07:27	pdxleif	just implicit conversions
2014-11-04 21:07:35	mdedetrich	pdxleif: yeah, but you have static type system, that at least gives you some sough of reasoning

2014-11-04 21:07:40	pdxleif	true
2014-11-04 21:07:53	aarvar	so, how do you reason in clojure?
2014-11-04 21:07:59	mdedetrich	like the difference in having a complex heirechies with static typing and without static typing is massive
2014-11-04 21:08:28	mdedetrich	aarvar: composoability in clojure is typically horizontal, not vertical. Its easy to reason about what functions do when they are trivial
2014-11-04 21:08:33	--	gratimax is now known as gratimax|away
2014-11-04 21:08:35	mdedetrich	and your program logic is just composing those functions
2014-11-04 21:08:36	--	gratimax|away is now known as gratimax
2014-11-04 21:08:37	pdxleif	Yeah; the Ruby code I was afraid to refactor or really touch anything - who knows what all is doing what?
2014-11-04 21:08:38	aarvar	but they dont have types
2014-11-04 21:08:51	mdedetrich	also there is stuff like lighttable
2014-11-04 21:09:17	mdedetrich	aarvar: you don't have to have types to reason
2014-11-04 21:09:37	aarvar	yes you do, but you have to hold all the type information in your head
2014-11-04 21:09:49	mdedetrich	aarvar: which is easy, if the implementation is trivial
2014-11-04 21:09:57	mdedetrich	which is what I mean by horizontal composability
2014-11-04 21:10:05	pdxleif	In Ruby I guess the best I could hope for was stepping through w/ a debugger.  But then people monkeypatch the language to hell w/ stuff like ActiveSupport, and it makes it really hard to follow...
2014-11-04 21:10:10	aarvar	but there's virtually no cost to having said types be handled by the compiler
2014-11-04 21:10:21	mdedetrich	there is plenty of cost
2014-11-04 21:10:24	aarvar	like
2014-11-04 21:10:57	mdedetrich	pdxleif: im actually a fan of stuff like sinatra, because that emphasises composing stuff out of simple parts
2014-11-04 21:11:16	mdedetrich	its in Ruby, but you don't deal with stuff like Active Record and its 20 subclass implementations
2014-11-04 21:11:37	jok	Do you guys recommend any books
2014-11-04 21:11:38	mdedetrich	aarvar: pollack, creator of lift, made a really good point in comparing clojure and scala
2014-11-04 21:11:49	sgronblo	aarvar: you define easy first :)
2014-11-04 21:11:49	aarvar	who said scala has to represent typed languages?
2014-11-04 21:12:23	mdedetrich	aarvar: he had website that he coded for client that is unable to properly update, because it was coded in an older version of scala (2.9), and because everything is enforced through types, its not effective to update the site
2014-11-04 21:12:30	sgronblo	I love Haskell, but it's not an easy language
2014-11-04 21:12:42	aarvar	its not easier to update because everything is enforced by types? what??
2014-11-04 21:12:52	mdedetrich	clojure only really enforces your syntax, so as long as the syntax matches, having to deal with massive language upgrades is a lot easier
2014-11-04 21:12:58	jok	why does this aarvar person argue with everyone about everything
2014-11-04 21:13:20	mdedetrich	because he is taking over from dibblego being away
2014-11-04 21:13:28	aarvar	there's this thing called polymorphism. Polymorphism lets you reuse the same functions with different types
2014-11-04 21:13:37	aarvar	its really cool, you should try it
2014-11-04 21:13:57	mdedetrich	aarvar: completely unrelated to what I said, please try again

2014-11-04 21:16:15	mdedetrich	its just a monolithic framework, we in fact have the same thing in scala, its called Play, its still as bad in terms of design (in my opinion), but its more bearable because its in scala

2014-11-04 23:16:41	d_m	my sense is that the macro needs to know at compile-time what the type is.

2014-11-04 23:39:31	mdedetrich	macros are inevitable, typesystems have limits, and there are definitely generic designs which can't be implemented nicely by just sticking to the type system
2014-11-04 23:39:58	Milyardo	mdedetrich: I don't think thats why macros are ineveitable
2014-11-04 23:40:04	mdedetrich	jumping to macros straight away is foolish, as is outright ignoring
2014-11-04 23:40:16	aarvar	what do you need macros for
2014-11-04 23:40:50	mdedetrich	Milyardo: well the alternative to macros is either what happend in Java, where everyone wrote stuff in XML, or in Haskell, where Haskell gets swamped with compiler extensions to extend its typesystem
2014-11-04 23:40:59	Milyardo	macros are a representation of programs as data, you should be able to work with a program just like you would JSON or SQL
2014-11-04 23:41:16	aarvar	swamped with compiler extensions? are extensions bad or something?
2014-11-04 23:41:20	aarvar	and haskell has template haskell
2014-11-04 23:41:37	mdedetrich	aarvar: yes, that just proves my point that macros are inevitable
2014-11-04 23:41:46	Milyardo	in languages like LISP that are homoiconic macros are very natural
2014-11-04 23:41:56	aarvar	there are certainly uses for them
2014-11-04 23:41:57	mdedetrich	compiler extensions are btw, in essence, the same thing as macros, they are just not user defined
2014-11-04 23:42:35	mdedetrich	Milyardo: def agree with what you are saying, I think you just explained your reason in a different way

2014-11-04 23:43:47	Milyardo	I don't think compiler extensions are the same thing, in macros you only work with ASTs
2014-11-04 23:43:59	aarvar	but if you look at the question you asked, why do you have a class in the first place if you want a map?
2014-11-04 23:44:22	mdedetrich	aarvar: the asMap is there to automatically generate a CRUD system out of case classes
2014-11-04 23:44:25	mdedetrich	its to reduce boilerplate
2014-11-04 23:44:27	aarvar	and it seems like really you want an extensible record

2014-11-06 22:38:36	TU	tl;dr
2014-11-06 22:39:02	wabash	So, Cyrano helps his friend Christian talk to the woman he loves, because Christian is pretty lame and sounds stupid and the woman is repulsed a bit by this, or at least confused.
2014-11-06 22:39:28	wabash	So they rig something up where Christian does the Romeo wherfore the fuck are you here thing, and stands under her balcony
2014-11-06 22:39:38	wabash	and Cyrano stands in the bushes telling him what to say.
2014-11-06 22:39:44	wabash	The woman's name is Roxane.

2014-11-06 22:40:35	wabash	So, the joke is that you are Christian, and qu1j0t3 would by Cyrano (How's your nariz, qu1j0t3?), and he'd maintain the allusion of you being competent by whispering what to type!

2014-11-07 20:52:36	mrvisser	oh right, you defined the test class inside the shell, so import probably isn't necessary.
2014-11-07 20:53:17	mrvisser	not sure actually, it's likely you have to run something from the test framework to bootstrap everything and start the test suite

2014-11-07 20:54:45	mrvisser	not sure that's the problem. Seems you actually need the test framework's runtime environment to be bootstrapped
2014-11-07 20:55:03	mrvisser	is the test based on something like specs2?
2014-11-07 20:55:14	wabash	Right. So I need to do that from the sbt shell, but the class exists only in the console....
2014-11-07 20:55:22	wabash	Ye,s it's specs2, and the class extends that.

2014-11-07 20:58:57	wabash	If I can, from the console, tell the outer sbt shell to run "testOnly <testclass>", it will work. From sbt shell I could do it if testclass was defined in a file.
