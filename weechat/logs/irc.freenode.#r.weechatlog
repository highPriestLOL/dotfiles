2014-08-25 22:22:37	zzing	What is the best way to add a row to a data frame?
2014-08-25 22:23:07	tdsmith	"don't"
2014-08-25 22:24:25	zzing	so I should build up my lists, then  construct one?
2014-08-25 22:24:34	tdsmith	and you should preallocate your lists, too
2014-08-25 22:25:05	wildintellect	well that's not to say you can't add rows there is a simple way
2014-08-25 22:25:25	zzing	I am in a position to know the maximum size of rows
2014-08-25 22:25:37	zzing	Not necessarily what the actual count will be
2014-08-25 22:25:46	wildintellect	sure then preallocation is likely a good plan
2014-08-25 22:26:30	tdsmith	my_col = rep(NA, max_n) is a useful pattern

2014-08-25 22:27:21	wildintellect	zzing, anyways the answer is rbind
2014-08-25 22:27:39	wildintellect	if you have 2 data.frames of the exact same structure and want to make them into 1
2014-08-25 22:28:42	zzing	tdsmith, that could work to my advantage I think with the way my structure is
2014-08-25 22:28:51	zzing	wildintellect, I  will definitely keep that in mind

2014-08-25 22:29:59	wildintellect	performance
2014-08-25 22:30:25	wildintellect	it's just best practices to avoid when reasonable
2014-08-25 22:30:45	wildintellect	R's performance comes from preallocation of memory for lists/vectors of known sizes
2014-08-25 22:31:10	wildintellect	at least thats what I get from reading about it
2014-08-25 22:31:27	wildintellect	its also the same reason apply is better than loops
2014-08-25 22:32:41	tdsmith	you have to reallocate everything every time you add a row so it becomes a o(n^2) operation
2014-08-25 22:34:55	zzing	I like doubling the preallocation :-)
