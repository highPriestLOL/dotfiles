2015-04-01 16:15:54	dwbear	when df$category = some value, then df$newcol gets the mean df$anothercol where those rows have the same value.

2015-04-01 16:18:39	montalvo	i'm a little confused, haha
2015-04-01 16:18:49	dwbear	me too;-)
2015-04-01 16:19:04	dwbear	I have 3 classes of students
2015-04-01 16:19:15	montalvo	so the new column is made up of values that are the means of other rows?
2015-04-01 16:19:22	dwbear	I get reports that combine students of all three classes. 
2015-04-01 16:19:41	dwbear	I want to limit the calculation of certain stats to each class --
2015-04-01 16:20:17	montalvo	it sounds like you need to select the elements of the data frame you want to get the mean of by using which()
2015-04-01 16:20:18	dwbear	so I want to calculate the main of a value when the student (row) is in class1, using other members of class1
2015-04-01 16:20:40	montalvo	you could construct a vector of values through a for loop
2015-04-01 16:20:49	montalvo	then append that to your data frame with cbind()
2015-04-01 16:20:53	dwbear	'which' sounds like the right direction
2015-04-01 16:20:55	montalvo	but there may be a more clever way to do it
2015-04-01 16:21:09	montalvo	but yeah, which() is a function that is used to select data given logical arguments
2015-04-01 16:21:12	dwbear	I may be more clever to just split out all the data in to 3 separate files
2015-04-01 16:21:18	audy	dwbear like this? x <- subset(df, column == 'students I want'); mean(x$some_column)
2015-04-01 16:21:26	montalvo	even better
2015-04-01 16:21:38	dwbear	audy: that looks cool
2015-04-01 16:21:49	dwbear	so there is a subset function?
2015-04-01 16:21:55	montalvo	?subset
2015-04-01 16:22:20	audy	dwbear you could also just calculate the mean for all of the students and then separate them later
2015-04-01 16:22:47	audy	which would be better if you want to compare the classes later
2015-04-01 16:22:48	opa_	ave() function might work here
