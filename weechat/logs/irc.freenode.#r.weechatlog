2014-08-25 22:22:37	zzing	What is the best way to add a row to a data frame?
2014-08-25 22:23:07	tdsmith	"don't"
2014-08-25 22:24:25	zzing	so I should build up my lists, then  construct one?
2014-08-25 22:24:34	tdsmith	and you should preallocate your lists, too
2014-08-25 22:25:05	wildintellect	well that's not to say you can't add rows there is a simple way
2014-08-25 22:25:25	zzing	I am in a position to know the maximum size of rows
2014-08-25 22:25:37	zzing	Not necessarily what the actual count will be
2014-08-25 22:25:46	wildintellect	sure then preallocation is likely a good plan
2014-08-25 22:26:30	tdsmith	my_col = rep(NA, max_n) is a useful pattern

2014-08-25 22:27:21	wildintellect	zzing, anyways the answer is rbind
2014-08-25 22:27:39	wildintellect	if you have 2 data.frames of the exact same structure and want to make them into 1
2014-08-25 22:28:42	zzing	tdsmith, that could work to my advantage I think with the way my structure is
2014-08-25 22:28:51	zzing	wildintellect, I  will definitely keep that in mind

2014-08-25 22:29:59	wildintellect	performance
2014-08-25 22:30:25	wildintellect	it's just best practices to avoid when reasonable
2014-08-25 22:30:45	wildintellect	R's performance comes from preallocation of memory for lists/vectors of known sizes
2014-08-25 22:31:10	wildintellect	at least thats what I get from reading about it
2014-08-25 22:31:27	wildintellect	its also the same reason apply is better than loops
2014-08-25 22:32:41	tdsmith	you have to reallocate everything every time you add a row so it becomes a o(n^2) operation
2014-08-25 22:34:55	zzing	I like doubling the preallocation :-)

2014-09-01 09:55:27	ernst	if there's no variable 'df' defined in that environment it looks inside the parent's environemnt
2014-09-01 09:55:40	ernst	and for some reason the parent environment was different in the two cases

2014-09-01 11:43:54	Kabouik	Not sure I'm clear, please let me know

2014-09-01 11:49:27	Kabouik	It does represent the right data currently, but the three conditions (let's say A, B and C) counts do not start from 0. Only A count starts from 0, then B starts at A value, and C starts at A+B value
2014-09-01 11:50:05	Kabouik	I'd like all to plotter from 0 on the y-axis, and use a low opacity to show where there is superimposition of the curves
2014-09-01 11:50:39	tdsmith	hmm, that's what i thought you meant but i wouldn't have expected that stat_density would stack them
2014-09-01 11:50:48	Kabouik	I don't need the cumulative display

2014-09-01 11:57:44	mrflick	You often run those with Rscript
2014-09-01 11:58:08	mrflick	so you can either do Rscript script.R or add a shebang to the top of your script file “#! /usr/bin/Rscript”
2014-09-01 11:58:20	tdsmith	Kabouik: i think with dplyr something of the form df %>% group_by(x, y, z) %>% summarize(integral=some_integral_function(t, insects)) is the right format but i don't know what the right way to fill in the "some_integral_function" is
2014-09-01 11:58:29	mrflick	or whereever our Rscript is located
2014-09-01 11:59:48	tdsmith	i guess you just need a sum, here
2014-09-01 11:59:50	Tyzao	mrflick: ah, so if I used TextWrangler to edit, the shebang would point to my local R framework?
2014-09-01 11:59:58	Kabouik	Thanks tdsmith, I'll check that
2014-09-01 12:00:25	mrflick	Tyzao: no. the path on the server
2014-09-01 12:00:42	mrflick	Tyzao: the server must have R installed. R does not create self-contained binaries
2014-09-01 12:00:43	Tyzao	ok
2014-09-01 12:00:43	Kabouik	Yes here a simple sum would be enough, for this data. It just reminded me a question I had some weeks ago for another data set

2014-09-01 13:19:20	docdoak	I have an assignment that is supposed to "show how variable the ranges are, and exclude outliers" as well as showing the mean. Should I remove the outliers before finding the mean or after? 
2014-09-01 13:19:24	lseactuary	or i do added variable plots
2014-09-01 13:19:47	docdoak	lseactuary: plot()
2014-09-01 13:20:02	docdoak	?plot for documentation

2014-09-09 22:22:12	naught101	tdsmith: the answer is that I need is that '.' is the whole dataframe. 
2014-09-09 22:22:26	naught101	not really sure what the difference between do() and mutate() is though....
2014-09-09 22:24:18	naught101	so, like this: iris %>% do(data.frame(s=apply(.[1:4], 1, sum), .)) 
2014-09-09 22:24:21	naught101	awesome
2014-09-09 22:24:28	naught101	mutate doesn't have a '.'
2014-09-09 22:24:55	tdsmith	mutate adds columns that are functions of other columns; do lets you perform an arbitrary transformation
2014-09-09 22:25:46	naught101	yeah. Mutate also uses data.table internally, right, to avoid copying the dataframe? I suppose that do can't do that, so is probably less efficient?

2014-09-10 14:27:26	docdoak	test <- c("Hi", "Bye", "See ya", "Later", "Hi", "Sup", "Bye", "Howzit", NA)
2014-09-10 14:27:38	docdoak	:-/
2014-09-10 14:27:42	docdoak	What I've been using so far
2014-09-10 14:27:54	docdoak	once I can get that working, then I'll extrapolate
2014-09-10 14:31:10	mrflick	so like test <- c("Hi", "Bye", "See ya", "Later", "Hi", "Sup", "Bye", "Howzit", NA);tt<-table(test); names(tt[tt=max(tt)]) ?
2014-09-10 14:31:22	docdoak	yeah, I got that far
2014-09-10 14:31:26	docdoak	the only problem is if there's a tie
2014-09-10 14:31:38	docdoak	then when I return the names (as well as the rest)
2014-09-10 14:31:43	mrflick	tthat should return them both as a vector
2014-09-10 14:31:43	docdoak	it just bumps everything over by a column
2014-09-10 14:32:09	docdoak	ok lemme try it exactly how you have it
2014-09-10 14:32:46	mrflick	well, how are you “packageing” the results?
2014-09-10 14:33:02	docdoak	I think that may be where my problem is
2014-09-10 14:33:11	docdoak	I'm just using c() to package them
2014-09-10 14:33:18	docdoak	and then names() <- c()
2014-09-10 14:33:39	mrflick	yeah, that’s the problem
2014-09-10 14:33:40	docdoak	is there a better way to 'name' them?
2014-09-10 14:33:44	docdoak	ah ok
2014-09-10 14:33:47	docdoak	What would you recommend?
2014-09-10 14:33:57	mrflick	well, it’s more about storing them. if you put them in a list, a list can hold vectors
2014-09-10 14:34:13	docdoak	ah
2014-09-10 14:34:19	mrflick	a simple vector cannot (and that’s what c() generally coerces stuff to(
2014-09-10 14:34:26	docdoak	ah I see
2014-09-10 14:34:37	docdoak	perfect!
2014-09-10 14:34:42	docdoak	That worked

2014-09-10 15:08:42	tnks	we're a half-new to R, and we're trying to understand what good well-factored code looks like.
2014-09-10 15:08:51	tnks	the thing we're looking for is namespacing.
2014-09-10 15:09:29	mrflick	R doesn’t really have a good concept of namespacing outside of packages
2014-09-10 15:09:55	tnks	that's the impression we're getting, but it's unsettling when you get used to it in other languages.
2014-09-10 15:10:10	mrflick	well, R isn’t like other languages :)
2014-09-10 15:10:15	tnks	the "." naming convention seems like it's got some potential to confuse people with the object system.
2014-09-10 15:10:36	tnks	we were almost inclined to make a hierarchy by naming convention using "."
2014-09-10 15:10:53	tnks	and we just asked ourselves if we should use underscore instead.
2014-09-10 15:10:55	mrflick	that would be a very bad idea
2014-09-10 15:11:10	mrflick	underscore - slightly better
2014-09-10 15:11:23	tnks	okay, lay it on us. . . what would you do?
2014-09-10 15:12:09	mrflick	but if you have a lot of parent/child class/subclass relationships then you might want to rethink things. R APIs tend to be pretty flat
2014-09-10 15:12:58	mrflick	assuming you’re developing a package, think about how you want the usert to interact with your functions. also consider what other pacakges/functions they would most liekly be using to manipulate data
2014-09-10 15:13:58	tnks	k, thanks.
2014-09-10 15:14:03	mrflick	but i probably shouldn’t have spoken up because i’ve gotta run. if there’s a package you like, then read it’s source. that may give suggestions but there are no hard guidelnes at this point.
2014-09-10 15:14:27	mrflick	good luck

2014-09-14 12:17:04	marvinlund	i have a dataframe with yearly observations for several individuals. how can I perform the following regression: (a_{t+1} - b_{t+1}) ~  (a_{t} - b_{t}) for every individual, each regression should be estimated yearly (yearly coefficients, p-values etc)
2014-09-14 12:17:45	bosie	marvinlund: subset?
2014-09-14 12:17:47	marvinlund	i tried "dynlm((a_{t+1} - b_{t+1}) ~ L((a_{t+1} - b_{t+1}), 1)" but have some doubts about it..
2014-09-14 12:18:25	marvinlund	bosie: yes, I split the dataframe before performing the regression such that only a subset (i.e. year t and year t+1) is included in the regression sample
2014-09-14 12:18:37	bosie	i thought you would split by individual
2014-09-14 12:19:09	marvinlund	sorry, not for every individual, every year. my bad.
2014-09-14 12:19:49	bosie	how do you have an annual coefficient?
2014-09-14 12:19:52	bosie	if you subset by year?

2014-09-14 12:39:39	ferros	:D
2014-09-14 12:39:44	bosie	if i were in severe pain, i would still have to wait 6 weeks
2014-09-14 12:39:55	bosie	if i get into severe pain tomorrow, i wouldnt even bother going to the hospital
2014-09-14 12:39:57	bosie	its disgusting
2014-09-14 12:39:57	ferros	a joke is what it is
2014-09-14 12:40:00	bosie	yes
2014-09-14 12:40:11	bosie	especially since iaam employed and i pay more into the nhs than i did back home
2014-09-14 12:40:12	ferros	and to think about that in the US it's actually worse
2014-09-14 12:40:17	bosie	ye

2014-09-14 12:42:22	bosie	there is also no pension scheme here
2014-09-14 12:42:33	bosie	so a lot of ppl when they get older actually have no money cos salaries are so low
2014-09-14 12:42:51	ferros	That's why I'm thinking of Switzerland or Germany more than England lately.
2014-09-14 12:43:07	bosie	i _wish_ i had a job in ch

2014-09-14 13:02:53	faheem_	are a lot of people still using ggplot2? i had a frustrating experience last year. i opened a bunch of bugs, and they were all summarily closed without being fixed.
2014-09-14 13:03:17	faheem_	ggplot2 bugs, that is. there is a python port, but i'm not sure how usable it is 
2014-09-14 13:03:44	bosie	i do
2014-09-14 13:03:46	bosie	what are the bugs
2014-09-14 13:04:05	faheem_	bosie: i'd have to look at the links. it was github i think.
2014-09-14 13:04:23	faheem_	does github let you select per project by user?

2014-09-14 13:07:10	faheem_	they could have left them open.
2014-09-14 13:07:43	faheem_	actually the last one was user error. so really three bugs. even so
2014-09-14 13:07:45	bosie	faheem_: agreed
2014-09-14 13:08:16	faheem_	the first and the third are actually kind of annoying. and probably fixable.
2014-09-14 13:08:34	faheem_	actually, almost certainly fixable.
2014-09-14 13:08:45	faheem_	anyway, whatever. i don't use R much otherwise.

2014-09-14 13:22:17	ferros	What bosie is trying to say, in his rather rude manner, is that while your issues are very important indeed, they aren't the first priority when looking at the big picture of the needs of the whole community, faheem_.
2014-09-14 13:22:51	ferros	bosie, where are your English manners?
2014-09-14 13:23:36	bosie	what ferros said
2014-09-14 13:24:49	faheem_	ferros: whatever. personally, i would try to fix a bug if it clearly described. of course, i might fail.
2014-09-14 13:25:08	bosie	faheem_: the str function is interesting
2014-09-14 13:25:20	faheem_	the devs (really two people) wouldn't even give me the time of day. and i spent quite a lot of time debugging them. as you can see by the issue.
2014-09-14 13:26:14	bosie	faheem_: mate, those two guys are developing 6 out of the 10 most used packages in the R world
2014-09-14 13:26:27	bosie	faheem_: additionally they are writing an IDE for R
2014-09-14 13:26:48	bosie	faheem_: what you describe as 'a lot of time debugging' is not really that much, is it?
2014-09-14 13:27:08	faheem_	sometimes bugs remain unfixed, because they are too hard to fix. or nobody knows how to fix them. i know of instances like that.
2014-09-14 13:27:10	bosie	faheem_: that being said, the str seems to be going for the default?
2014-09-14 13:27:42	faheem_	bosie: "quite a lot of time is relative". i spent a month tracking down no 2.
2014-09-14 13:27:57	bosie	https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/issues/817 this one?
2014-09-14 13:28:10	faheem_	since i didn't know anything about ggplot2 internals
2014-09-14 13:28:42	faheem_	bosie: yes, that one.
2014-09-14 13:29:04	faheem_	not full time, of course
2014-09-14 13:30:04	faheem_	anyway, i was told it was too much text to look at. fine attitude. i'm sure they got a lot of motivated helpers that way
2014-09-14 13:30:20	bosie	well
2014-09-14 13:30:26	bosie	without defending them
2014-09-14 13:30:31	bosie	it is hard to follow your writeup
2014-09-14 13:30:58	bosie	it would probably take forever to understand/debug it and yea... 2 ppl. shitload of packages
2014-09-14 13:31:17	bosie	and IIRC they hardly have any helpers
2014-09-14 13:31:36	bosie	baptiste and koshke helped at some point
2014-09-14 13:31:39	bosie	but they stopped too
2014-09-14 13:31:58	ferros	Which IDE, bosie?
2014-09-14 13:32:06	bosie	ferros: rstudio?
2014-09-14 13:32:21	ferros	Ah
2014-09-14 13:32:23	ferros	I like that
2014-09-14 13:32:29	ferros	I've it on me server running 24/7
2014-09-14 13:32:37	bosie	cool
2014-09-14 13:32:46	ferros	Then I can log in if I give a presentation on some random laptop if they have Interwebs
2014-09-14 13:32:48	ferros	very useful
2014-09-14 13:33:02	bosie	actually, gotta cook
2014-09-14 13:33:14	bosie	faheem_: good luck. might be easier to use matplotlib ;)
2014-09-14 13:33:22	faheem_	bosie: i included a patch. it's not that hard to follow if you are already familar with the code
2014-09-14 13:33:56	faheem_	the larger issue is that without encouraging a community, the software will die when the original devs lose interest in it.
2014-09-14 13:34:19	bosie	faheem_: thats a given
2014-09-14 13:34:20	faheem_	and we are only talking about 2 people, afaik.
2014-09-14 13:34:27	bosie	faheem_: if hadley dies R has a problem
2014-09-14 13:34:47	faheem_	bosie: not dies. loses interest. which mostly seems to have happened already.
2014-09-14 13:34:50	bosie	where is the patch?
2014-09-14 13:35:06	bosie	faheem_: yes, he has no interest in ggplot cos he does a lot of other things
2014-09-14 13:35:28	faheem_	i've worked on a bunch of projects, little bits. usually the devs will at least talk to you.
2014-09-14 13:35:39	faheem_	especially if you are clearly putting in effort
2014-09-14 13:35:55	bosie	try that on projects like mysql or mozilla. good luck ;)
2014-09-14 13:36:57	faheem_	bosie: towards the bottom of the issue. i really should submit it. but i'd have to load all that stuff into my brain again. and i don't even use R much. plus there is that stupid guithub pull reuest thing. i'll try to get to it this month

2014-09-14 16:20:34	mrflick	sorry, i’m jumping in late here . i don’t know what the orignal problem is. but if you need to convert a matrix to data.frame, just use data.frame() or as.data.frame()

2014-09-17 22:41:32	vyadhaka	mrflick: with binomial rv, it's easy to change from P[X <= x] and P[X > x] as it only takes integers, but how to do this with normal rv, for example P[X >= 8] for X~N(8,4.8), I am guessing I cannot use lower.tail=false with pnorm, I am guessing I have to use 1-pnorm(8,8,4.8), is that right?
2014-09-17 22:44:32	mrflick	there is zero probability that a continuous variable will ever take a particular varie. so 1-p() is just fine

2014-09-17 22:48:23	vyadhaka	mrflick: yes thats right, so the equality for normal RV just means it's 0 so 1-p() and pnorm(x,m,var, lower.tail=FALSE) should give the same value, right

2014-09-21 00:10:34	MrMisterMister	My question is regarding: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/10838/produce-a-list-of-variable-name-in-a-for-loop-then-assign-values-to-them
2014-09-21 00:11:01	MrMisterMister	How do I add the newly created vector to an existing data frame within the for loop?
2014-09-21 00:11:33	mrflick	you should not be creating variables like that. that’s just bad R code.

2014-09-21 00:14:53	mrflick	poly(rnorm(5), 4)
2014-09-21 00:15:14	mrflick	then just cbind() that in to your DF.

2014-10-11 12:10:38	mrflick	R variables don’t have labels.
2014-10-11 12:13:09	mrflick	the Hmisc package does provide some labelling functionality (http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/Hmisc/docs/as.data.frame.labelled) but this is not part of base R

2014-10-11 12:49:53	MoonKid	R can produce *TeX output, right? So it is perfect for publication. But I don't want to re-edit the R output for my publication. For example SPSS: I create PDF-output automaticly for my analysies. After that I just have to crop them and include them in my *TeX files with pdfpages. But that is a workaround.
2014-10-11 12:50:38	MoonKid	I don't see how to work with R without lables? I have to use "describtive names"? Ok, am I allowed to use spaces and special characters in my var-names? I think not.
2014-10-11 12:51:04	MoonKid	And by the way. My labels are to long and would create a lot of visual noise in the code itself.
2014-10-11 12:52:29	mrflick	well, then use the Hmisc label() command as originally suggested
2014-10-11 12:52:41	--	efm is now known as efm_
2014-10-11 12:54:53	MoonKid	I tried Hmisc. But it doesn't work. Using table(var) doesn't show me the labels.

2014-10-11 13:03:40	MoonKid	As you pointed out: R is a toolf for calculation. So I don't need "descriptive names" vor var. In that case I need logical easy to read and short to write without making visual noise in the code(!). But the publication after that should be easy to read an "beautiful". ;) So for me it is a general concept in working with data to differ between the data itself, their names (variable name) and their description (label). Of course I need value 
2014-10-11 13:03:40	MoonKid	lablels vor some variables, too.
2014-10-11 13:05:49	MoonKid	SPSS is quite bad and work with stone age concepts. I hated it but had to work with. But handling lables was easy with it. Please don't missunderstand me. Of course I don't say R is bad. It isn't! So now I need to understand how all the R-people can work with R without having variable lables and value lables. I really want to understand your workflow in that case.
2014-10-11 13:07:27	MoonKid	e.g. can you understand this simple table(var) output without lables?1  2  3  4

2014-10-13 12:51:01	sayo-	any idea on how to draw confidence intervals in a dotplot with lattice?
2014-10-13 12:51:37	montalvo	so you mean error bars on a scatterplot?
2014-10-13 12:51:58	montalvo	i'm not familiar with lattice but i have my own functions for drawing error bars
2014-10-13 12:52:31	montalvo	it's funny how R doesn't have anything decent built in for error bars - though if I'm ignorant of a default way to do this, someone should let me know!

2014-10-13 12:53:32	sayo-	I'm using lattice so far (I'm not married with lattice, but I decided to try it for this assignement)
2014-10-13 12:53:46	sayo-	it proved pretty decent so far
2014-10-13 12:53:53	montalvo	lattice is the one that lets you plot many sub-plots in one, right?
2014-10-13 12:53:55	montalvo	i tend to just use layout
2014-10-13 12:54:15	sayo-	it has a dotplot function which works nice but I can't figure out how to add CI

2014-10-13 12:54:24	montalvo	oh, gotcha
2014-10-13 12:54:28	montalvo	yeah sorry, no idea on that front
2014-10-13 12:54:34	sayo-	no problem mate :D
2014-10-13 12:54:38	montalvo	best of luck!
2014-10-13 12:54:45	sayo-	tyty <3
2014-10-13 12:55:13	montalvo	can you manually add little bits and pieces to each dotplot in a lattice?
2014-10-13 12:55:27	montalvo	if you're so inclined, you could just draw them on manually, but it's a pain
2014-10-13 12:55:56	sayo-	I tried to do that
2014-10-13 12:56:03	sayo-	shouldn't be that hard

2014-10-13 12:56:52	montalvo	arrow() works quite well
2014-10-13 12:56:59	montalvo	just make sure to set the arrow angle to 90
2014-10-13 12:57:22	sayo-	nice tip :D
2014-10-13 12:58:47	bettycla1p	I know this is an R channel, but maybe someone here can answer a SAS question (or point me to a SAS irc channel, which I haven't been able to find). My problem is that sas is no longer running on the command line without requiring X; but I just want to run it in batch mode. I know this is a long shot, but...any ideas?

2014-10-13 13:06:18	montalvo	to answer your question though

2014-10-13 20:30:20	aboudreault	hello. I have a column *timestamp* in my data. I would like to display them as a kind of *elapse time*.
2014-10-13 20:30:28	aboudreault	Any idea what I should look for?
2014-10-13 20:31:06	mrflick	can you be more spefic? what’s the input and what’s the desired output?
2014-10-13 20:31:12	mrflick	*specific
2014-10-13 20:33:53	aboudreault	mrflick, in fact, my timestamp is like: 1413246630779 
2014-10-13 20:34:33	aboudreault	and basicially, I would like something that considerer the first timestamp as the start time, and compute the elapse time
2014-10-13 20:34:57	mrflick	what does that number represesnt?
2014-10-13 20:35:18	mrflick	sounds like you could just subtract the min of that column from all the other values to get elapsed time
2014-10-13 20:36:15	aboudreault	yep, something like that would be ok
2014-10-13 20:36:28	aboudreault	I just don't know how I should accomplish that.
2014-10-13 20:36:41	aboudreault	to create a kind of new computed column
2014-10-13 20:36:50	mrflick	data$ts - min(data$ts) or something like that
2014-10-13 20:37:04	mrflick	if you want you can save it to a new column data$ellapsed<-data$ts - min(data$ts)

2014-10-18 18:39:39	erikk	How can I do a prediction from a multiple regression model when I just have one set of inputs? Ex: I've got regression <- lm(df$mpg ~ df$hp + df$disp)
2014-10-18 18:40:09	erikk	I'd like to find the predicted mpg given a specific value for each of hp and disp
2014-10-18 18:40:47	bosie	erik: predict?
2014-10-18 18:41:35	dondelelcaro	erikk: ideally you'd do regression <- lm(mpg ~ hp + disp,df); and then use predict(regression,data.frame(hp=5,disp=2))
2014-10-18 18:41:38	dondelelcaro	or similar

2014-10-26 13:28:57	popsch	it seems data.table has some problems with lists. my trial and error playing around even crashed it so I had I restart R: setkey( data.table(rbind(list(x=c("a","b"), y=1),list(x=c("c","d"), y=2))), y)
2014-10-26 13:29:27	popsch	I know it's convoluted, but that's what the internal data structure looks like. It's a list of lists, which is rbinded together
2014-10-26 13:29:48	popsch	anyone got an idea why setkey doesn't work?

2014-10-26 13:41:07	mrflick	but a list of lists doesn’t quality as a “table” in the sense that data.tables/datar.frames work best with rectangular data. you’ll likely run into many problems with such a structure.
2014-10-26 13:42:03	popsch	I just want to keep the list in the data table, so I can look it up in the end
2014-10-26 13:42:14	popsch	I won't perform operations on it until the very end
2014-10-26 13:42:34	popsch	mrflick, DT <- data.table(rbind(list(x=c("a","b"), y=1),list(x=c("c","d"), y=2))); setkey(DT,y)
2014-10-26 13:42:42	popsch	this also doesn't work
2014-10-26 13:42:52	mrflick	And by “deson’t work” what do you mean?
2014-10-26 13:44:19	mrflick	try DT <- data.table(rbind(list(x=c("a","b"), y=1),list(x=c("c","d"), y=2))); DT[,y:=unlist(y)]; setkey(DT,y)
2014-10-26 13:44:35	mrflick	but again, this is a bad idea in my opinion
2014-10-26 13:45:02	mrflick	if you want, you could do a look up to an index that you could then use to extract from a list of lists. but shoving a list into a data.table just seems wrong.
2014-10-26 13:45:03	popsch	DT <- data.table(rbind(list(x=c("a","b"), y="foo"),list(x=c("c","d"), y="bar"))); DT[,y:=unlist(y)]; setkey(DT,"y")
2014-10-26 13:45:08	popsch	that also doesn't work
2014-10-26 13:45:27	popsch	I tried unlist() before and it started crashing DT
2014-10-26 13:47:31	mrflick	then i think you should re-evaulate your implementation. storing lists in a data.table is probably not the way to go.

2014-10-26 13:48:06	popsch	creating a lookup key is cumbersome and error prone
2014-10-26 13:48:27	popsch	when I remove a row in one, I have to make sure that I also remove it in the other to keep things consistent.
2014-10-26 13:49:04	popsch	I'm currently upgrading packages and saw that a new version of data.table is available. maybe/hopefully that fixed the problem.
2014-10-26 13:50:27	mrflick	well, keep in mind that’s not the scenario data.table was designed to improve, and it often overloads it’s syntax to behave differently for lists by design

Is there someplace else I should be putting my “just run once I really mean it” stuff?  I thought from the startup help that .First was the right place.

2014-10-31 19:00:51	jbecker	so what's the part that you are worried about and what is going on?

2014-10-31 19:03:36	piklu	if u run

2014-10-31 19:03:44	piklu	u ll see warnings
2014-10-31 19:04:31	jbecker	n1 is the right name for me to just paste that code?

2014-10-31 19:08:38	piklu	yes
2014-10-31 19:08:39	jbecker	if you can walk me through this line by line it's look very inefficient potentially
2014-10-31 19:08:45	jbecker	I got just lots of streaming ___
2014-10-31 19:08:53	jbecker	how long should it take to run on a powerful machine?
2014-10-31 19:09:03	piklu	break it
2014-10-31 19:09:08	piklu	and u ll see warnings
2014-10-31 19:09:27	piklu	it is a code under development like POC, i have been trying various things on this

2014-10-31 19:09:37	piklu	final code will be much diff.
2014-10-31 19:10:10	jbecker	you gotta wrap some of this in functions to debug it at least and see what's going on at that step that breaks each time in the loop
2014-10-31 19:10:16	jbecker	something isn't what you expect it to be

2014-10-31 19:11:07	bob2017	jbecker - what isn’t what he expects is the list object.  he’s trying to subset an element of a list before he creates the element, and it isn’t making the second list object implicitly.
2014-10-31 19:11:30	piklu	i just wanna store data
2014-10-31 19:11:33	bob2017	jbecker:  he doesn’t want to pre-allocate because he said the data comes in as a stream.  but he’s running an experiment on the same data 100x?
2014-10-31 19:11:42	bob2017	if you just want to store the data then dump it into a sql database.  
2014-10-31 19:11:43	piklu	in something tht I can traverse without preallocation
2014-10-31 19:12:00	bob2017	that’s not all though.
2014-10-31 19:12:02	piklu	no, it is going to be used for analysis
2014-10-31 19:12:12	bob2017	you want to continuously update the data and continuously analyze it.  
2014-10-31 19:12:18	piklu	yessss
2014-10-31 19:12:26	piklu	precisely
2014-10-31 19:12:32	bob2017	you’re basicallly trying to do real time processing, but you refuse to use any data structure other than an R list()
2014-10-31 19:12:44	bob2017	which is like the least suitable possible structure.
2014-10-31 19:12:44	piklu	i ll use, if u suggest 
2014-10-31 19:13:09	bob2017	meanwhile the function example doesn’t make sense, because on the one hand you want realtime analysis of streaming data, and on the other you’re running an “experiment” on the same data 100 times.
2014-10-31 19:13:10	jbecker	well real time processing should not be storing data in R
2014-10-31 19:13:15	jbecker	that'll be a disaster
2014-10-31 19:13:18	bob2017	jbecker:  exactly.
2014-10-31 19:13:35	jbecker	stream it into a db made for fast writes... hell even a keyvalue store like redis
2014-10-31 19:13:57	piklu	bob2017 - this is not an experiment that will run 2 times and give same result
2014-10-31 19:14:06	piklu	this code runs 100 times to give 100 diff results
2014-10-31 19:14:19	bob2017	jbecker:  he doesn’t want to do that because he wants all the data resident in memory so he can continuously reprocess it while the data streams in.  
2014-10-31 19:14:41	bob2017	piklu:  yeah, you said that, and it doesn’t make a lot of sense, because you’re taking data streaming in.
2014-10-31 19:14:59	jbecker	I don't fully understand why or how but streaming any reasonable size data into R will just kill whatever machine you're on fast if it's large enough to matter that it's streaming
2014-10-31 19:15:05	bob2017	if this is an experiment, then why do you need to reprocess the data in real time?  
2014-10-31 19:15:09	piklu	if u read code - definition of z6 - you ll understand.
2014-10-31 19:15:15	bob2017	why not just take the streaming data and reprocess it.
2014-10-31 19:15:36	bob2017	i did read the code, and it didn’t make a bit of sense.
2014-10-31 19:15:48	piklu	yes read z6. again.
2014-10-31 19:15:51	piklu	Can you offer me a data structure to store it ?
2014-10-31 19:15:53	piklu	btw.
2014-10-31 19:15:54		ghr (~ghr@2.217.228.50) has joined #R
2014-10-31 19:15:55	bob2017	i tried to be polite about it but right now i’m hungry and in a crummy mood so i’m being blunt.
2014-10-31 19:16:10	jbecker	also you're allocating a df beforehand as empty... what's the pupropse if you're not preallocating memory?
2014-10-31 19:16:39		seonghak (~seonghak@112.169.81.79) has joined #R
2014-10-31 19:16:42	bob2017	i’ve given you three different data structures, and you’ve rejected all of them because you insist that you need to do things with the data that are mutually contradictory, don’t make sense, and shouldn’t be implemented in un-parallelized R.
2014-10-31 19:16:59	bob2017	meanwhile, your code isn’t setup to handle streaming data, its setup to handle pre-existing data. 
2014-10-31 19:17:02	jbecker	piklu I'm working on understanding what the code is, but I can tell you that a native R data structure is not appropriately for streaming data of any size that some of the concerns bob2017  seems to say you have would actually matter
2014-10-31 19:17:06	piklu	jbecker: those untilized variable are portion of old code which this evolved into.
2014-10-31 19:17:21	bob2017	so this whole project is a recipe for a disaster — which i’ve tried to tell you 8 different ways.
2014-10-31 19:17:22	jbecker	Where should I focus to know what you're doing?
2014-10-31 19:17:41	piklu	bob2017: why do u think it is a final production code? and not a POC
2014-10-31 19:17:43	piklu	small one.
2014-10-31 19:18:09	bob2017	piklu: i know its not production code.  its i-can’t-figure-out-what, which is what i’ve said to you a few times.
2014-10-31 19:18:12	bob2017	anyway
2014-10-31 19:18:13	jbecker	also nested for loops... ouch.
2014-10-31 19:18:19	bob2017	yeah!
2014-10-31 19:18:24	jbecker	the scoping on this is just weird
2014-10-31 19:18:31	piklu	jbecker: just show me in a small sample how to allocate 20 diff numbers in a n dimensional data structure which does not needs to be initialized and can store on any index any data.
2014-10-31 19:18:32	bob2017	again - yeah!
2014-10-31 19:18:32	jbecker	POC or not I have to break this into functions just to understand and debug it
2014-10-31 19:19:18	bob2017	jbecker:  i tried that.  it doesn’t make sense broken into functions and he can’t give a clear explanation of what its supposed to do, why its built that way, or why he provided this as sample code since it doesn’t seem to actually match his project.
2014-10-31 19:19:23	jbecker	there's no such structure in R that has a structure you can allocated into a dimension and index that doesn't preexist
2014-10-31 19:19:26	bob2017	anyway, i’m going to dinner
2014-10-31 19:19:47	jbecker	R can create something empty, with a number of indices or with no indicies but that requires recopying and adding to whatever it is each time
2014-10-31 19:20:00	jbecker	but there's no such thing as n dimensions and you cna just randomly insert into a space
2014-10-31 19:20:14		ghr (~ghr@2.217.228.50) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2014-10-31 19:20:20	jbecker	as far as I know. I don't even know how that would work with R's memory allocation implementation of objects
2014-10-31 19:20:37	bob2017	jbecker - actually, you can do that by adding columns to a dataframe, or entries to a list in certain cases, but none of that is going to help him.  you can also use xts to create a rolling time series but it isn’t n-dimensional.  you could tryprogramming on the language to handle n dimensions, but that won’t work with his need for continuous streaming.
2014-10-31 19:20:40	bob2017	its not n-dimensional
2014-10-31 19:20:46	bob2017	its uncertain-dimensional.
2014-10-31 19:20:57	bob2017	he claims that the number of dimensions isn’t known to start and changes as the data accumulates.
2014-10-31 19:20:59	bob2017	none of it makes sense

2014-10-31 19:24:51	piklu	jbecker: http://paste.ofcode.org/32uXPb43sZMSw7TLdaYxDxz
2014-10-31 19:24:55	piklu	take this from here.
2014-10-31 19:25:09	piklu	I have cleaned it up.
2014-10-31 19:25:29	piklu	only problem I have is, I wanna assign values of d2
2014-10-31 19:25:35	piklu	to some data structure
2014-10-31 19:26:07	piklu	but they will be done in a fashion of how the if condition is evaluated ( 3rd if )
2014-10-31 19:26:27	piklu	the code will now print 1-10 and than finish
2014-10-31 19:26:32	piklu	so you know how much it has ran.
2014-10-31 19:26:35	bob2017	here’s a question — what in the hell are z 1-5?
2014-10-31 19:27:10	bob2017	you generate 5 different sets of random integers with a range of 1:10500 — and then you modulo them all by 2
2014-10-31 19:27:17	bob2017	why in the heck would anybody *do that*
2014-10-31 19:27:32	piklu	they are random numbers - a way in which the program is picking his preferences
2014-10-31 19:28:00	bob2017	piklu - they are, at random, either 0 or 1, because you make them all %%2
2014-10-31 19:28:10	piklu	bob2017 : because random over here is not random. I need a much higher level of radomization, my program coudl get patterns.
2014-10-31 19:28:37	bob2017	piklu - what is the possible purpose of sampling random integers from 10000 to 10500 in order to get random 1’s and 0's?
2014-10-31 19:28:48	bob2017	why don’t you just… sampe 1 and 0!
2014-10-31 19:29:13	piklu	it doesn't works the way I wanted. It is like a special case.
2014-10-31 19:29:14	piklu	trust me
2014-10-31 19:29:17	piklu	am not fool.
2014-10-31 19:29:29	bob2017	piklu - no… i think you don’t understand what your code is written to do.
2014-10-31 19:29:34	bob2017	do you know what %% 2 does?
2014-10-31 19:29:43	piklu	It is perfectly doing it what is is meant to do.
2014-10-31 19:29:47	piklu	Yes.
2014-10-31 19:29:54	piklu	It is picking moduls 2
2014-10-31 19:29:59	piklu	either will be 0 or 1
2014-10-31 19:30:07	piklu	and z6 than can range for 0-5
2014-10-31 19:30:24	piklu	but rather than sampling it from directly 0:5
2014-10-31 19:30:29	bob2017	piklu: then why in the heck are you sampling from 10000 to 10500?
2014-10-31 19:30:44	piklu	because the sampling in R is not random
2014-10-31 19:30:48	piklu	it is patternized !
2014-10-31 19:30:55	piklu	and I could see it in my data
2014-10-31 19:30:57	bob2017	and its still patterened in your code.
2014-10-31 19:30:59	piklu	same numbers being repeated.
2014-10-31 19:31:08	piklu	no, its way better.
2014-10-31 19:31:09	bob2017	1 there are alternative random number generators
2014-10-31 19:31:21	jbecker	set seed?
2014-10-31 19:31:23	bob2017	piklu - this is where i lose you.  it makes no sense.
2014-10-31 19:31:25	jbecker	just change the seed a few times
2014-10-31 19:31:31	piklu	yes. random.org - which was blocking me, because my code needs a random number so many times like millions of times
2014-10-31 19:31:42	jbecker	with the same seed all random number generators end up reproducing sequences
2014-10-31 19:31:45	bob2017	jbecker - or he could just use SuppDists and use rbinom
2014-10-31 19:31:49	jbecker	yup
2014-10-31 19:32:02	jbecker	but anyway ok you're just trying to ge ta random number between 0 and 5
2014-10-31 19:32:17	bob2017	he wants a random integer between 1 and 6 in binomial distribution
2014-10-31 19:32:53	bob2017	except not only has he not solved his randomness “problem”, but he’s also not getting an unbiased distribution.  I’ll let him figure out why.
2014-10-31 19:33:29	piklu	bob2017 : I will eventually try a lot of random number makers, infact we will have our own external C++ code doing it for us.
2014-10-31 19:33:31	bob2017	piklu - next problem in your cfode, is the combination of nn and n loops.
2014-10-31 19:33:45	bob2017	piklu - great.  your current code makes no sense.
2014-10-31 19:33:56	jbecker	well ok let's get away for a second
2014-10-31 19:33:57	bob2017	anyway, back to the nn and n loops.  you said this is streaming data.
2014-10-31 19:34:01	jbecker	from random generators
2014-10-31 19:34:03	jbecker	and all that bs
2014-10-31 19:34:07	piklu	bob2017: trying to make sense out of my code rather than helping me allocate that data to data structure.
2014-10-31 19:34:14	jbecker	what is the core last step supposed to do and break out of it
2014-10-31 19:34:28	jbecker	Well the thing is I don't understand your data generating process beause I don't know what the code does
2014-10-31 19:34:33	bob2017	what your code is apparently going to do, is 100 times, its going to loop through the OHLC structure.  And its going to run 100 times through the OHLC structure *every*single*time*a*new*datapoint*is*added*
2014-10-31 19:34:35	jbecker	if I do, I can better understand what it is and how to store it
2014-10-31 19:35:07	bob2017	Ok, now I’m really going to dinner… 
2014-10-31 19:35:14	bob2017	good luck!
2014-10-31 19:35:33	piklu	jbecker: Can i make a problem for u and answer to that will help me
2014-10-31 19:35:34	piklu	right?
2014-10-31 19:35:49	jbecker	yup. I want to get away from some of the mechanics of the outer stuff
2014-10-31 19:35:52	jbecker	and understand the core problem
2014-10-31 19:35:55	jbecker	and work out from there
2014-10-31 19:36:13		_Atom_ (~jawat@172.56.21.179) has joined #R
2014-10-31 19:36:19	jbecker	Let's look to see if your issue even has anything to do with your real world stuff or is just a weird process for your POC that we can do a different way
2014-10-31 19:36:28	jbecker	and if it has to do with the real stuff, I wnat to be able to laser focus on that
2014-10-31 19:36:45	piklu	jbecker: may be, but believe me, I am a new coder on R only.
2014-10-31 19:37:06	piklu	but I know in terms of why randomization is needed.
2014-10-31 19:37:24	piklu	and when I look at graphs its really working the way I expect, almost purely random.
2014-10-31 19:37:49	piklu	In layman words, exp is what I chose to store my data in.
2014-10-31 19:38:06	piklu	It is getting the difference of Close on 1st row to the next row
2014-10-31 19:38:10	piklu	and store it in d2
2014-10-31 19:38:15	jbecker	well i get that but I am primarily an R/SQL guy so it helps me to understand what's going on
2014-10-31 19:38:30	jbecker	ok so you want to take the first row and subtract the next row
2014-10-31 19:38:36	jbecker	and store that difference in a new frame
2014-10-31 19:38:52	piklu	I always store that difference but the way of storage matters
2014-10-31 19:38:55	jbecker	1) That's fine, but in R, columns are the better structure to store your data if that's the process, in all likelihoood
2014-10-31 19:39:30	piklu	I would love if u can help me. in understanding R's data structures plz.
2014-10-31 19:39:43	piklu	when my variables sk1==0 and sk3==0 than a new sequence starts
2014-10-31 19:40:19	piklu	exf is increased
2014-10-31 19:40:25	piklu	exk is set to 0
2014-10-31 19:40:32	piklu	and again exk is increased
2014-10-31 19:40:41	piklu	and exf will be increased when condition matches
2014-10-31 19:40:44	piklu	like....
2014-10-31 19:40:50	piklu	12345
2014-10-31 19:40:53	piklu	123
2014-10-31 19:40:58	piklu	123456789
2014-10-31 19:41:01	piklu	12345
2014-10-31 19:41:03	piklu	randomly
2014-10-31 19:41:09	piklu	I wanna store these data points like that
2014-10-31 19:41:11	piklu	thats all.
2014-10-31 19:41:22	piklu	but it can go to any length
2014-10-31 19:41:36	piklu	like 1234567891011......10000
2014-10-31 19:41:41	piklu	or it can be just 12
2014-10-31 19:41:55	piklu	and these sequence can keep coming infinitely upto a long time.
2014-10-31 19:42:14	piklu	I want to store another number at end of sequence
2014-10-31 19:42:17	jbecker	that's not something R is great at. There's no in-memory appending to a list
2014-10-31 19:42:32	jbecker	each assignment will recopy all the data and reassign everything
2014-10-31 19:42:55	jbecker	which is why doing nested for-loops like that is very much anathema to idiomatic R
2014-10-31 19:43:01	jbecker	as is storing indices like that
2014-10-31 19:43:02	jbecker	etc
2014-10-31 19:43:30	jbecker	so if you want to store N amount of M-sized vectors, R will be very slow
2014-10-31 19:43:51	piklu	i can use a tree to make it.
2014-10-31 19:44:04	piklu	in python or C++ or C or C# or anything else.
2014-10-31 19:44:05	jbecker	I would recommend writing out the result to a database like PostgreSQL using a text-type like array or json and then retrieving it for analysis later
2014-10-31 19:44:30	piklu	jbecker: it has to be loaded in memory for analysis. so something has to store it right, SQL is just serializing it.
2014-10-31 19:44:49	jbecker	well you can pull it in later in memory for analysis as tabular with NA fills and it's fine
2014-10-31 19:44:59	jbecker	or as key-value pairs wth the sequence being the value side
2014-10-31 19:45:05	jbecker	but R is not good at building that data up like that
2014-10-31 19:45:08	jbecker	very bad actually
2014-10-31 19:45:08	piklu	there is nothing I can do?
2014-10-31 19:45:26	piklu	implement a tree in R ?
2014-10-31 19:45:38	jbecker	write a class, overload the assignment operator, use C++ to do the structure, and then you won't have memory issues
2014-10-31 19:45:47	jbecker	There's no linked list concept
2014-10-31 19:45:57	jbecker	So I don't know how you do it without writing a ton of custom stuff
2014-10-31 19:46:00	jbecker	not off the top of my head
2014-10-31 19:46:19	jbecker	R isn't design to collect streaming, schemaless data
2014-10-31 19:46:28	jbecker	maybe the RJSON package can help
2014-10-31 19:46:42	jbecker	but R has a lot of shit to make it easy to use databases because that's not what R is
2014-10-31 19:47:14	piklu	this kind of data can only be stored in neo4j
2014-10-31 19:47:58	piklu	:(
2014-10-31 19:48:12	jbecker	i mean there is literally no way to append an element to a list in R without a full copy.. data.table substantially rewrites the data.frame type to allow for in-memory assignment stuff
2014-10-31 19:48:41	jbecker	but I don't work with graph data
2014-10-31 19:48:49	jbecker	which si why the other data I suggested looking at the graph data packages that are out there
2014-10-31 19:49:01	jbecker	because someoen may have written the class and assignment functions already to do some of this
2014-10-31 19:49:12	jbecker	Bioconductor, instead of CRAN may be a good place to look
2014-10-31 19:50:04	jbecker	I mean you can define the paths with the parent-child thing like I mentioned the other day and then it can be a consistent table and it's not a problem
2014-10-31 19:50:09	jbecker	but for some reason that didn't work either you said
2014-10-31 19:50:12	piklu	can work with Rstudio?
2014-10-31 19:53:01	jbecker	bioconductor? I dont' see why not but I never use it
2014-10-31 19:53:15	jbecker	 the graph for you is because 1234578 and 1234 are valid
2014-10-31 19:53:28	jbecker	and you can say 578 -> 1234 for the first 
2014-10-31 19:53:33	jbecker	correct?
2014-10-31 19:53:47	piklu	means?
2014-10-31 19:54:06	jbecker	http://files.meetup.com/3576292/networks%20in%20R%20using%20igraph.pdf
2014-10-31 19:54:16	jbecker	as in 578 points to 1234 which means 1234578
2014-10-31 19:54:27	jbecker	did you look at the igraph stuff?
2014-10-31 19:56:38	piklu	looking
2014-10-31 19:58:02	piklu	jbecker: it can work
2014-10-31 19:58:38	piklu	need a better tutorial
2014-10-31 19:58:56	jbecker	yeah that one may not be great but it's fairly popular from what i know
2014-10-31 19:59:19	jbecker	in general there are a few things you're doing non-idiomatically that may make your code unbearably slow as you get further from POC that may be worth knowing
2014-10-31 19:59:34	jbecker	there's no value for pre-assigning a variable that's not preassigned ot the actual size it's oging to be 
2014-10-31 19:59:52	jbecker	R will just copy and destroy during the assignment process. you gain nothing from declaring variables up top like that
2014-10-31 20:00:12	jbecker	for example
2014-10-31 20:00:23	piklu	once am sure its working, i can go to implement it in C++ or Python

2014-10-31 20:29:47	jbecker	and because operators are vectorized you don't have to iterate through a vector to subtract
2014-10-31 20:30:04	jbecker	and lets put aside that z crap that is all to create osmething like this

2014-10-31 21:19:06	jbecker	and things like dplyr() can have call semantics on a sqllite db (that's basically in memory) to do analysis as though it was a data.frame()

2014-10-31 21:22:50	piklu	ok
2014-10-31 21:22:58	piklu	i ll use recursion.
2014-10-31 21:23:03	jbecker	the return value is a vector of undetermined length, it's traversing two values of the same length right, the z6 and the n1 value
2014-10-31 21:23:30	jbecker	so I would write a function that takes n1 and z6 as vectors, does recrusive calls until your terminating condition, then returns that in a vector
2014-10-31 21:24:17	jbecker	you can then do an easy list with vector for n1, vector for z6, and vector of vectors for the values
2014-10-31 21:24:21	asahi	i'm trying to see how many values in a given dataframe column equal a certain integer value using sum(df$var==4) but that's giving me NA. any ideas?
2014-10-31 21:25:00	jbecker	asahi you are returning logical with some missing values probably, better to do soemthing like table(df$var==4)
2014-10-31 21:25:14	jbecker	or sum(df$var==4, na.rm=TRUE) will probably work

2014-11-01 00:56:54	hydrox24	How can I remove all rows except for those who have the most recent date, doing this independently (finding a different recent date) for each factor.
2014-11-01 00:58:01	mrflick	how about creating a sample input dataset and show the desired output. your description is a bit imprecise
2014-11-01 01:00:10	hydrox24	That's fair enough. I'll look into pasting it somewhere.
2014-11-01 01:00:19	hydrox24	How can I create a sample input dataset easily?
2014-11-01 01:01:54	mrflick	some suggestions here for that: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example
2014-11-01 01:02:08	hydrox24	Thanks.
2014-11-01 01:05:45	hydrox24	I've looked into it a littl more, and I've just decided to manually fix it. A lot easier on my time at the moment.

2014-11-02 21:05:32	aaas	i was hoping to find the unique values in a column of my datafame, so I used unique(df$column)....however with 4 million rows it seems to choak on my computer...not sure what algorigthm it uses to find uniqueness, but maybe it's a beter way?  I just tried levels(factor(df$col)) but it seems to be stuck on that too...  Not sure why this is so hard, it seems to say there are ~5000 factor levels, shuldn't it be able to simply list those?

Before the forloop, there is N = 10^5 - 1, where this -1 is due to the degrees of freedom. I'm not sure why when determining the pvalue.upper and lower the 1 is added back to N?
