2015-04-01 16:33:03	emauton	okeuday_bak: Huh, so Erlang doesn't send a signal to the child?
2015-04-01 16:33:32	okeuday_bak	emauton: not unless you add code to do so, but you need to get the pid from the port to do that
2015-04-01 16:34:01	okeuday_bak	emauton: you would need to use SIGKILL if you care about the port ignoring some signals... it depends on the situation
2015-04-01 16:34:22	emauton	okeuday_bak: Understood.
2015-04-01 16:34:36	bencc	you get the pid from open_port
2015-04-01 16:34:51	emauton	okeuday_bak: I guess I'm just surprised that there's not some standard "hey, we're finished here" signal it sends, even USR1 or somethingl

2015-04-01 16:34:53	okeuday_bak	emauton: the other weird situation is if you suspend the erlang VM pid, what does the port do?
2015-04-01 16:35:16	emauton	Good question, yeah, I mean in terms of what *should* it do ...
2015-04-01 16:35:33	okeuday_bak	emauton: if you use external CloudI services, it does SIGKILL once the terminate timeout expires, but Erlang ports require custom code

2015-04-01 16:36:04	okeuday_bak	bencc: you get a port from open_port which is like a pid, but different
2015-04-01 16:36:18	emauton	okeuday_bak: Cool. I'm sorry to say that I've never played with CloudI. It's in my todo list, I'll get there some day. :o)
2015-04-01 16:36:24	bencc	so it's not an os pid?
2015-04-01 16:36:31	okeuday_bak	emauton: cool
2015-04-01 16:37:11	bencc	is there a way to 'link' the erlang process and the externa process?
2015-04-01 16:37:14	emauton	bencc: Nope. You'll need erlang:port_info to get that
2015-04-01 16:37:21	emauton	(the OS pid)
2015-04-01 16:37:30	okeuday_bak	bencc: a port is a connection to something, so it could be a socket, something external the Erlang VM, in this case it is connecting to the two pipes being used for an OS pid, but you don't know what the OS pid actually is
2015-04-01 16:39:34	okeuday_bak	bencc: you can link to a port if you want to, i.e., by calling erlang:link(Port), but the problem here is the Erlang port code not seeing the close in the Erlang port source code
2015-04-01 16:39:48	bencc	so I can be left with zombie processes
2015-04-01 16:39:55	bencc	maybe I need to implement a driver to fix it?
2015-04-01 16:40:07	okeuday_bak	bencc: not necessarily, it is calling OS fork and it is a child of the Erlang VM
2015-04-01 16:40:41	okeuday_bak	bencc: the good way to fix it normally is call poll() in the Erlang port program, and detect the close

2015-04-01 16:41:29	okeuday_bak	bencc: it should be POLLHUP
2015-04-01 16:41:37	bencc	the problem is not detecting a when the external program is closed
2015-04-01 16:41:53	bencc	but making sure the external process is closed if the erlang pid crashes
2015-04-01 16:42:10	bencc	I stopped the erlang vm and now the external process was removed
2015-04-01 16:42:26	bencc	before I think I had 4 zombie external processes
2015-04-01 16:42:45	darkling	A zombie process is nothing to worry about.
2015-04-01 16:42:57	bencc	drakling: won't it use resources?

2015-04-01 16:43:13	darkling	It takes up precisely two resources: one pid, and one process structure.
2015-04-01 16:43:34	darkling	The pid is used to identify it, and the process structure is there to keep a record of the return code.
2015-04-01 16:43:36	bencc	what if it's doing work?
2015-04-01 16:43:44	emauton	Assuming the parent exits at some point and is not badly-behaved (the Erlang VM shouldn't be), it'll get reaped by init after a little while.
2015-04-01 16:43:55	darkling	If it's a zombie process, in Z state, that's it. There's nothing more.
2015-04-01 16:44:01	darkling	If it's doing work, it's not a zombie.
2015-04-01 16:44:06	emauton	bencc: A zombie is not doing work by ... what darkling said
2015-04-01 16:44:11	bencc	ok
2015-04-01 16:44:18	okeuday_bak	bencc: if you want to cleanup a bad Erlang port, you would need the OS pid of the Erlang port and to do an OS kill on it
2015-04-01 16:44:33	bencc	I meant a process that still doing some work but not needed
2015-04-01 16:44:40	bencc	ok
2015-04-01 16:44:45	okeuday_bak	bencc: yeah, you need to kill that
2015-04-01 16:44:58	emauton	(actually, it could be reaped by something other than init these days, see PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER in prctl(2) on Linux, but it's still unlikely)
2015-04-01 16:45:39	bencc	okeuday_bak: what do you mean by poll() ?
2015-04-01 16:46:07	okeuday_bak	bencc: like a normal C poll() function call in poll.h
2015-04-01 16:47:03	okeuday_bak	bencc: other programming languages normally have a poll function too (or select)
