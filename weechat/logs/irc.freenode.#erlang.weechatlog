2014-09-13 12:59:24	nox	Why should *everything* be expressed in terms of text?
2014-09-13 12:59:32	hlieberman	I mean...
2014-09-13 12:59:34	nox	That wouldn't mean we couldn't code or extend the editor.
2014-09-13 12:59:54	nox	Why shouldn't the view itself have notions of markers, fixit hints, and whatnot?
2014-09-13 12:59:54	hlieberman	That text isn't going to end up in your codebase unless you somehow intentionally extend emacs to do so.
2014-09-13 13:00:13	nox	hlieberman: Or unless my 42 plugins somewhat conflict with one another, you mean?
2014-09-13 13:00:31	tristan3	it does have the ability to add the markers, which aren't part of the buffer
2014-09-13 13:00:39	nox	tristan3: Oh cool.
2014-09-13 13:00:52	nox	How does printing line numbers work now btw?
2014-09-13 13:01:11	tristan3	printing where? I have line numbers in the left margin

2014-09-13 13:03:43	nox	Or is that still based on minor modes that actually insert text right there and makes it seem like it's not part of the buffer?
2014-09-13 13:04:56	nox	If it still works like this, how does the minor mode for your previous screenshot not conflict with line numbering?
2014-09-13 13:06:21	tristan3	it is a separate part of the gui, so when that inline eror rmessage is there it does not conflict with the line numbers
2014-09-13 13:07:19	nox	Ok.
2014-09-13 13:09:09	tristan3	better default would go a long way with that stuff

2014-09-13 14:46:04	geardev	my guess is that you add a machine or two to your project (unsure how you do this)
2014-09-13 14:46:20	geardev	is a machine generally considered to be a core?

2014-09-13 14:47:16	geardev	the question that should have been asked, maybe, is how do you add more machines/cores to your existing project?
2014-09-13 14:47:20	jlouis_	geardev: in Erlang a single VM running is called a node(). These run several schedulers, usually one per physical core.
2014-09-13 14:47:22	electricshaman	geardev: From Erlang's perspective, I think an instance of the VM is considered to be a separate node.

2014-09-13 14:47:57	jlouis_	nodes communicate with each other over a distribution protocol making inter-node communication seamless
2014-09-13 14:47:58	tristan3	geardev: most likely you don't want to do this. once you start down that path you are now building a distributed system and not a website
2014-09-13 14:48:19	geardev	or maybe the question is how do you add another instance of a vm to your project?

2014-09-13 14:48:51	jlouis_	geardev: the question to ask is: why do you need to share state between the instances?
2014-09-13 14:49:05	tristan3	you don't add nodes to a project, you boot nodes of your project
2014-09-13 14:49:13	jlouis_	If you don't then just run multiple of them on separate machines

2014-09-13 14:51:52	tristan3	if you have 2 machines, you just boot your project on both
2014-09-13 14:52:33	geardev	tristan3: and then you rely on service discovery of some sort so they are able to communicate?
2014-09-13 14:53:02	tristan3	geardev: no.why do you need to communicate between nodes?
2014-09-13 14:53:18	geardev	load balancing?

2014-09-13 14:54:04	geardev	if it's not a web node?
2014-09-13 14:54:10	geardev	this is all theoretical atm
2014-09-13 14:54:19	tristan3	then a lot more questions arise about what is needed, hehe
2014-09-13 14:54:44	geardev	okay i won't take it there then :)
2014-09-13 14:55:29	jlouis_	geardev: if you need sharing of state, then you need to approach this as any other distributed project. Most notably, you need to trade off guarantees
2014-09-13 14:55:43	tristan3	there are various discovery implementations to create dynamic clusters, but if you arebuliding something right now in Boss, you probably don't want/need that
2014-09-13 14:55:58	jlouis_	tristan3: transit-erlang is quite complete. We are missing some few extensions, but they should be easy to add

2014-09-13 14:56:18	tristan3	right, which is why just keeping your nodes stateless and using an off the shelf storage layer is better
2014-09-13 14:56:49	tristan3	they could be used for sharing config variables or node discovery
2014-09-13 14:59:22	tristan3	jlouis_: sweet. going to give it a try in my clojurescript fronted project
2014-09-13 15:00:02	jlouis_	tristan3: it is internally consistent due to quickcheck
2014-09-13 15:00:15	jlouis_	it is probably externally consistent as well due to the exemplar tests

2014-09-14 10:38:15	maveneagle	Hi, I am a new to erlang, have a doubt regarding the gen_tcp:recv function, is that function non blocking? if yes, then i presume that the erlang vm will use the OS' non blocking io to poll for data availablity and then resume the process if data is available
2014-09-14 10:38:19	maveneagle	am i right in saying that?
2014-09-14 10:38:40	nox	maveneagle: It blocks the Erlang process calling it, but won't block the whole VM.

2014-09-14 18:58:06	develop7	erliphant: well, I'm using {active, true} already and {active, once} and alike doesn't seem to make much sense to me, because I'm processing constant flow of 10Mib/s UDP packets. So what I'm trying to achieve with {active, false} is to reduce possible overhead on this stage and prevent packet drops.
2014-09-14 18:58:10	essen	these changes are planned to land in 2.0 right after OTP 18

2014-09-14 18:59:00	ingsoc	variable bindings are a must
2014-09-14 18:59:09	essen	should be fully implemented but no optimization
2014-09-14 18:59:23	erliphant	develop7 - so you do a blocking recv on the socket?
2014-09-14 18:59:54	erliphant	develop7 - I assume this is because a function call is cheaper than handling a message for every packet?
2014-09-14 19:00:39	develop7	erliphant: not exactly using — I'm about to implement this. and wondering if there's OTP way to do this.
2014-09-14 19:00:41	--	jcaprice_ is now known as jcaprice
2014-09-14 19:00:46	essen	ingsoc: the way i'm doing things it also makes many things able to use atoms so that simplifies greatly the writing of code
2014-09-14 19:01:38	erliphant	develop7 - the otp way is to use active sockets and just handle each packet as a message inside gen_fsm/gen_server
2014-09-14 19:02:11	erliphant	develop7 - but I doubt it will keep up with 10Mib/s
2014-09-14 19:02:36	ingsoc	essen: I will keep an eye on 2.0.  anything you can do to aid with pattern matching is deffo where things should move,  the one area i think is a pest is the req object with the methods to access various parts of a request
2014-09-14 19:02:47	jlouis	develop7: one problem you will have to face is the backlog at the kernel level as well
2014-09-14 19:02:48	develop7	erliphant: I hope {active, false} is cheaper, yes. and I hope it'd help prevent drops by reading all the packets, caching them by BEAM VM, and avoid kernel buffer overflows.
2014-09-14 19:03:02	essen	ingsoc: Req is gone from most of the return values too :)
2014-09-14 19:03:04	develop7	erliphant: oh, it does keep up
2014-09-14 19:03:12	develop7	*does not
2014-09-14 19:03:14	essen	i should have something pushed at the end of the month
2014-09-14 19:03:15	ingsoc	fully functional maps with pattern matching to extract everything you want from the req "map" would be superb
2014-09-14 19:03:26	jlouis	erliphant: {active, false} is probably going to be slower
2014-09-14 19:03:32	jlouis	but {active, 1024} might work
2014-09-14 19:03:48	essen	no you can't access the Req still, and never will, but you can call a function to get a map of things (and validate these things at the same time)
2014-09-14 19:03:51	develop7	jlouis: why it could be slower?
2014-09-14 19:04:07	jlouis	develop7: more calls back and forth
2014-09-14 19:04:07	essen	like qs and others
2014-09-14 19:04:30	essen	GET = cowboy_req:match_qs(Req, Fields)
2014-09-14 19:04:35	essen	:D
2014-09-14 19:04:36	ingsoc	essen: what is the timeline for the 2.0
2014-09-14 19:04:37	jlouis	on R16+, ports are way more asynchronous, so you can gain speed by getting out of that loop
2014-09-14 19:04:49	essen	release after OTP 18
2014-09-14 19:04:55	jlouis	but chances are you won't be able to keep up if it is UDP
2014-09-14 19:04:59	ingsoc	so spring next year ?
2014-09-14 19:05:04	ingsoc	ok
2014-09-14 19:05:07	essen	maybe
2014-09-14 19:05:26	jlouis	100 megabit is easily at a point where the default kernel buffer of 8 packets (i believe) isn't enough
2014-09-14 19:05:32	ingsoc	well things are moving along.  tbh i like the cautious nature of the erlang ecosystem as i like stability
2014-09-14 19:05:53	essen	things change a *lot* more than they seem
2014-09-14 19:06:17	erliphant	jlouis - I've had some surprising results with [{active, once}, {packet, 4}] with tcp. It was slower than parsing the data in erlang with pattern matching.
2014-09-14 19:06:45	jlouis	erliphant: which OTP release? A lot of this was adressed fairly recently
2014-09-14 19:07:00	jlouis	In R17, {active, N} is by far the neatest way of doing it
2014-09-14 19:07:12	jlouis	I get really good results with that for almost no effort
2014-09-14 19:07:14	erliphant	jlouis - I think it was r16 - I did try active, N and it was much better
2014-09-14 19:07:47	develop7	jlouis: we've raised kernel buffer to 200M (there's 48G RAM) BTW but had drops. ~8M keeps up well
2014-09-14 19:07:47	essen	active N is going to be interesting to use indeed
2014-09-14 19:08:15	jlouis	develop7: chances are that with UDP you run into trouble easily
2014-09-14 19:08:23	develop7	are there any examples of {active,N} I could look at?
2014-09-14 19:08:33	jlouis	because there is no push-back so it is easy to outrun the system

2014-09-14 19:09:27	ingsoc	if you have a single  udp process you can try setting process_flag(priority, high)
2014-09-14 19:09:29	erliphant	develop7 - you want to get a baseline on what a gen_server can do in terms of message rate. Its not as high as you might expect. It's built for convenience and reasonable speed but IMHO gen_server isn't super-fast.
2014-09-14 19:10:10	jlouis	gen_server is usually pretty fast
2014-09-14 19:10:29	jlouis	spread loads on multiple socket ports maybe?
2014-09-14 19:10:40	erliphant	develop7 - I'd say 60-90K messages / second is what I'd expect. What is your best guess jlouis?
2014-09-14 19:10:40	jlouis	so more cores can go havoc on the UDP streams
2014-09-14 19:11:04	jlouis	erliphant: depends on too many factors to tell

2014-09-14 19:15:11	jlouis	erliphant: measure! It depends on the machine
2014-09-14 19:15:15	jlouis	and size of the message
2014-09-14 19:15:54	jlouis	develop7: throwing perf at the beam.smp process and verifying where you spend your time also works wonders
2014-09-14 19:16:01	jlouis	it can often track down where time is spent
2014-09-14 19:16:08	erliphant	jlouis - I did measure on a pretty fast modern box and my numbers came out to about 90K msg/second with gen_server. But I was just looking for an alternative view.
2014-09-14 19:16:10	jlouis	more than 20% in beam_emu.c is a smell usually
2014-09-14 19:16:28	jlouis	erliphant: probably about right
2014-09-14 19:17:09	jlouis	Erlang is not particularly fast in a single gen_server. The power is you can easily get 24 cores to do work
2014-09-14 19:17:19	erliphant	jlouis - which does place an upper bound on total bandwidth for a use case like develop7's. But your idea with iptables magic and multiple processes is really interesting.

2014-09-15 18:16:23	cdepauw	what I'm looking for most are erlang analogs to model and controller as they would exist in other envioronments
2014-09-15 18:16:30	cdepauw	maybe I'm looking for the wrong thing
2014-09-15 18:17:03	cdepauw	i'm not sure but if i could see something 'correct' maybe I could follow that example
2014-09-15 18:17:04	essen	model and controller would be an OTP application you write that does these things, and then your web layer just talks to that application
2014-09-15 18:17:21	essen	keep the web stuff separate from the logic
2014-09-15 18:17:30	essen	not just views

2014-09-21 21:38:46	hlieberman	Hello.
2014-09-21 21:38:50	hlieberman	A segfault in the VM itself?
2014-09-21 21:39:01	hlieberman	Those tend to be a problem with a NIF.
2014-09-21 21:39:55	zhuoyikang	yes ,i don't use nif, and : segfault at 18 ip 00000000004565f4 sp 00007fffe9178698 error 4 in beam[400000+1e9000]
2014-09-21 21:40:23	hlieberman	In what program?
2014-09-21 21:40:28	--	troutwine is now known as troutwine_away
2014-09-21 21:40:53	zhuoyikang	in my game servers
2014-09-21 21:41:31	zhuoyikang	how can i solve the beam segfault , no coredump and erl_crash.dump
2014-09-21 21:42:28	zhuoyikang	just dmesg: segfault at 18 ip 00000000004565f4 sp 00007fffe9178698 error 4 in beam[400000+1e9000]  and i track this code in erlang :  0000000000456150 <erts_bfalc_init>:
2014-09-21 21:42:34	hlieberman	I've never seen an Erlang segfault when there's no NIF involved, but I'm sure things can happen.  You'll have to get a core dump out of the server, the same way you would with a C program.  Make sure the BEAM vm is running in a context that is instructed to create coredumps.

2014-09-23 22:38:36	cmk_zzz_	alisdair: I've only tried rafter briefly. The other ones seem to be in very early stages if I'm not mistaken (assuming you got the list from http://raftconsensus.github.io/)
2014-09-23 22:38:52	alisdair	rafter seemed the most far along to me
2014-09-23 22:39:04	alisdair	cmk_zzz_: yeah, i found that list plus one other one that seems incomplete
2014-09-23 22:39:35	alisdair	cmk_zzz_: rafter is listed as a product of basho, do you guys have plans for it in riak or was it just a research thing from a basho employee?
2014-09-23 22:40:51	cmk_zzz_	I'm not working for basho so can't really answer your question:) However, they have a paxos based implementation in riak 2.0 (riak ensemble) so I don't think rafter is going to make it into their product (but then again I'm only guessing)
2014-09-23 22:41:05	alisdair	oh i thought you were someone else, sorry
2014-09-23 22:41:32	cmk_zzz_	no worries. Apparently I *was* someone else
2014-09-23 22:41:55	alisdair	well yes, we all are, right?

2014-09-23 22:43:40	cmk_zzz_	raft seems like a simple protocol so if I get the chance to use something I might use rafter. The README however states it is not for production so might have to put some own effort int
2014-09-23 22:43:44	cmk_zzz_	*in
2014-09-23 22:44:53	alisdair	yeah, i was considering forking it
2014-09-23 22:45:01	alisdair	i need a distributed log for a thing
2014-09-23 22:45:12	alisdair	and kafka has some really worrisome caveats
2014-09-23 22:45:27	alisdair	and all the paxos implementations seem really slow and/or hand wavey

2014-10-11 17:30:28	jonmorehouse	so my question is what exactly does the Pid ! mean, does it mean that its executing on the process identified by Pid?
2014-10-11 17:31:01	hq1	jonmorehouse: it means http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#send-2
2014-10-11 17:31:14	vinoski	jonmorehouse: you can io:frwrite(user, "blah blah") to see your messages
2014-10-11 17:31:49	vinoski	jonmorehouse: Pid ! foo means send the message foo to the process Pid
2014-10-11 17:32:09	hq1	it means that the process Pid will get {self(), {store, Food}} delivered to its inbox
2014-10-11 17:32:22	hq1	assuming it's alive

2014-10-13 13:43:06	jlouis	There are no global values in an Erlang program. All execution happens in processes
2014-10-13 13:43:30	jlouis	So you need to write an execution loop for a process and have it pass the state to itself
2014-10-13 13:43:33	hlieberman	Right.  If you need to be able to reference things from anywhere, there are a couple of tools you can use.  Compile-time macros, if it's not going to change.
2014-10-13 13:43:45	hlieberman	Or you could use a database like mnesia or ets to hold the state.
2014-10-13 13:44:18	hlieberman	But in general, that's not necessarily the recommended way to do it.  jlouis is right - you should get used to using state passing if you're coding in Erlang.
2014-10-13 13:44:52	jlouis	Usually, you turn it around. Make a process which can take requests, and let the process search the state
2014-10-13 13:45:11	jlouis	then handle requests by passing messages back and forth

2014-10-20 22:31:24	OutlawStar	yes
2014-10-20 22:31:30	OutlawStar	i think i have just now discovered that

2014-10-20 22:31:36	OutlawStar	just application stuff
2014-10-20 22:31:41	OutlawStar	and then have a separate app.config
2014-10-20 22:31:48	OutlawStar	do i then use the -config arg?
2014-10-20 22:31:48	cmk_zzz	Yes, and I don't think it is usually recommended.

2014-10-24 17:20:33	solrize_	if the c++ thing is taking that long do you really need a NIF?  may be easier to put it in a separate process that can be under supervision, communicating through sockets to your erlang app

2014-10-24 17:30:48	subhrendu	really.. I thought erlang helps scaling to 1000's of cores
2014-10-24 17:30:49	solrize_	it's a small enough number of machines that you can prob get away with some ad hoc scheme
2014-10-24 17:31:07	solrize_	is this a long term production app, or some one-off computation you have to do?
2014-10-24 17:31:27	subhrendu	for production.. not a one-off
2014-10-24 17:32:08	solrize_	BEAM uses multi core parallelism on a single machine, and erlang distribution lets you connect up multiple machines and monitor and restart processes between them... but erlang's goal is nonstop operation through redudancy, it's not a parallel computation platform

2014-10-24 17:32:53	solrize_	there might be something like it in erlang
2014-10-24 17:32:55	subhrendu	well I dont intend to do parallel computation, but parallel processing
2014-10-24 17:33:04	solrize_	yeah that's what i mean
2014-10-24 17:33:53	solrize_	erlang is great for handling lots of concurrent tcp connections so you could have some local controller on each machine, communicating with a small erlang cluster that's handing out work packets
2014-10-24 17:34:04	solrize_	but erlang clusters usually have a handful of nodes at most

2014-10-24 17:36:56	solrize_	matter
2014-10-24 17:37:34	solrize_	you'll just have the usual hadoop-like issues of keeping track of work items, restarting failed tasks, rebooting stuck machines etc
2014-10-24 17:37:49	subhrendu	hi robert, Before going into multiple servers, i wanted to know if I want to create a erlang system on top of my C++ app so that I can both seamlessly run the C++ app on a multi-core system and then use the same code-base over distributed servers, whats the best way to go about that
2014-10-24 17:38:02	solrize_	basically when 90% of your items are done, the rest are straggling through, so kill them all and start them again from the beginning
2014-10-24 17:38:23	solrize_	stop using so many buzzwords and say what you're trying to do :)
2014-10-24 17:39:05	solrize_	you are going to need a lot of code (that you write yourself, or that's supplied in some package like hadoop) to manage that distribution

2014-10-24 17:41:21	subhrendu	As i said, I have a C++ app which prcoesses a data stream (e.g say a multimedia stream) and outputs a different data stream. The C++ app right can operate on a single server machine (scales up and down relatively well on multi-core on a single machine with C++ threads). I want to take the processing to multiple machines and do distribute  work seamlessly across cores of multiple machines
2014-10-24 17:43:47	solrize_	stop saying seamlessly unless you can tell us exactly what a "seam" is
2014-10-24 17:44:16	subhrendu	by seamlessly I mean not writing special code for that
2014-10-24 17:44:36	solrize_	you are either going to have to write special code or use special code that someone else wrote
2014-10-24 17:44:43	solrize_	this stuff is not trivial

2014-10-24 17:46:54	solrize_	millions of separate streams?  separate tcp connection for each one?
2014-10-24 17:46:56	subhrendu	ok let me try to make it a little simpler. suppose I want to process 1000 files concurrently on 1000 cores (which lets supposeI have access to)
2014-10-24 17:47:16	solrize_	the files are already on the local disks, or do you have to get them there?
2014-10-24 17:47:18	subhrendu	and the prcoessing app is a C++ app.
2014-10-24 17:48:43	subhrendu	as I said.. let me ask the simplest qus: I have 1000 files in a disk, which i want to process concurrently across 1000 cores. (currently I have a C++ app which can process 1 file at a time).
2014-10-24 17:49:08	darkling	Condor. :)
2014-10-24 17:49:18	darkling	Sorry, HTCondor these days.
2014-10-24 17:49:21	solrize_	ok, you have 1000 files on ONE DISK, on ONE MACHINE.  and then there are 100 or so machines on a network, and you have to get the files to the remote machine for processing
2014-10-24 17:49:36	solrize_	is that what you are saying?
2014-10-24 17:49:44	darkling	Or, indeed, any batch queuing system, like Torque / Moab

2014-10-31 19:09:30	rvirding_	the version in ets module does step through table using ets:next. It has to do this as there is no way to evaluate a function except in the calling process
2014-10-31 19:09:43	rvirding_	there is no ets "process" in which to do this
2014-10-31 19:10:21	omarkj	yeah, I'm just doing this in the shell.
2014-10-31 19:10:28	rvirding_	the only things you can do directly on the table are the built-in operations like read/write/match/select
2014-10-31 19:10:30	omarkj	Remote shell that is, just manual ops work.
2014-10-31 19:11:40	omarkj	rvirding_: https://gist.github.com/omarkj/d009579e5a2a20927359 this is it. I don't see anything blearily horrible about it, but given it's ~100k or so records it's just taking a while.

2014-10-31 19:14:34	omarkj	If there are more than one, yeah.
2014-10-31 19:14:48	omarkj	(I expect to find one - e.g. the one I'm looping over)
2014-10-31 19:15:03	rvirding_	trouble is that every call to select will traverse the whole table
2014-10-31 19:15:20	omarkj	I could maybe be smart and only traverse the _rest_ of the table from the key.
2014-10-31 19:15:38	rvirding_	no way of doing that
2014-10-31 19:16:02	omarkj	I'm okay with it being slow.

2014-10-31 19:51:02	xapak	I am running some functional tests where I have to generate 100+ of data to send over a HTTP request. I am using crypto:rand_bytes(TestFileSize * ?MB), but looks like after at least some megabytes (like 180), it’ll give in. What other methods do you recommend to generate a good amount of data on-the-fly for this tests?

2014-11-01 00:30:35	jdavis	I am trying to build an erlang program to partition data among some number of nodes (on the order of 100, but it would be nice if it would scale effectively beyond that). The partitioning scheme is simple hash partitioning. Do you think that's a reasonable application of erlang? What areas might I run into performance problems?
2014-11-01 00:31:58	jdavis	The hash itself I can write as a NIF, but the number of nodes will vary, so I am guessing that I would use an ETS table to map the hash to a specific destination node.

2014-11-02 19:10:11	dubosec	Including that but not limited to that. Basiccally I am trying to determine whether I should learn erlang considering that I am not necessarily planning to write concurrent programs
2014-11-02 19:10:38	OutlawStar	IMO erlang is best suited for backend type stuff. Sure you could use it for a general purpose programming, but it could be like using a screwdriver to hammer in a nail
2014-11-02 19:10:51	OutlawStar	totally doable, just not necessarily the right tool for the job
2014-11-02 19:11:00	dubosec	Oh, okay. I am already working on assembly and planning to pick up forth, so I need a high-level general-purpose language
2014-11-02 19:11:18	dubosec	...to round it out
2014-11-02 19:12:16	OutlawStar	if you planning on doing concurrent stuff (non computational) erlang is nice, but for others not so much
2014-11-02 19:12:21	OutlawStar	at least in my experience
2014-11-02 19:12:25	OutlawStar	which is limited :)
2014-11-02 19:12:46	OutlawStar	erlang is also nice if you want to try using a purely functional language
2014-11-02 19:13:31	dubosec	I may pick it up anyway. Just good to know what its limitations are
2014-11-02 19:13:39	OutlawStar	its a cool language
2014-11-02 19:13:42	OutlawStar	i'm enjoying
2014-11-02 19:13:44	OutlawStar	it
2014-11-02 19:13:54	OutlawStar	but it does takes some dedication to learn lol
2014-11-02 19:15:02	dubosec	what do you like to do with it?
2014-11-02 19:15:31	OutlawStar	i using it currently to host a number of REST apis
2014-11-02 19:15:47	OutlawStar	I wrote an windows azure client in it as well
2014-11-02 19:16:07	OutlawStar	there is a webserver called cowboy

2014-11-02 19:16:13	OutlawStar	which is nice to fool around with
2014-11-02 19:16:59	OutlawStar	it really shines for its concurrency supporting and distributed features
2014-11-02 19:17:15	OutlawStar	Distrubuted computing is one of my passions, so thats why it appeals to me
2014-11-02 19:18:46	dubosec	hmm. I'll definitely take a look at it. I tried my hand at Haskell, but there is so much content knowledge that goes into it
2014-11-02 19:19:13	OutlawStar	ah, i was thinking about fooling around with that language, but I figured i've got enough on my plate for now

2014-11-02 19:19:47	OutlawStar	Haskell, is more math oriented (or so I read), so it didn't really appeal to me as much
2014-11-02 19:20:54	dubosec	I like the aims of Haskell, though, inasmuch as the type system keeps things organized. I'm hoping erlang will be a good presentation of functional principles without going overboard on the mathematics
2014-11-02 19:21:16	tristan3	and use dialyzer for types :)
2014-11-02 19:21:21	OutlawStar	yes
2014-11-02 19:21:31	OutlawStar	erlang has no built in type system
2014-11-02 19:22:29	hlieberman	The way I see it, programmers need to know a couple kinds of languages.  They should know a low-level language, like C, C++, or Rust.  They should know a high level object oriented language, like Perl, Python, Ruby, whatever.  And they should know a functional language, like Erlang, Clojure, or whatever.
2014-11-02 19:22:41	tristan3	you get some of the goodness of algebraic types with tuples+typespecs
2014-11-02 19:22:59	OutlawStar	Rust is considered a low lvl language?
2014-11-02 19:23:04	tristan3	yea
2014-11-02 19:23:06	hlieberman	You /can/ use any of them to do everything - hell, one of my friends, the crazy bastard, has a web server framework written in Bash.

2014-11-02 19:25:54	hlieberman	I think it was mostly to see if he could.  I don't think he uses it for anything.
2014-11-02 19:25:58	OutlawStar	lol
2014-11-02 19:25:59	hlieberman	I /hope/ he doesn't use it for anything.

2014-11-02 19:28:58	OutlawStar	so is there a reason not to use SetElement?
2014-11-02 19:29:14	OutlawStar	as apposed to explicitly recreating the tuple?

2014-11-02 19:30:48	hlieberman	setelement will behave somewhat non-expectedly inside of a loop context: http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/commoncaveats.html (\S 3.4)

2014-11-02 19:35:45	OutlawStar	but in general copying a list is the same as just creating a new list
2014-11-02 19:36:13	OutlawStar	so using it is fine in most scenarios?
