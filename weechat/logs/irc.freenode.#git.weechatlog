2014-08-26 18:18:04	MestreLion	I could cherry pick with --no-commit, and then slice the changes using `add -p`... but since all the changes would be in my working tree already, it would be hard to tell if the bits I'm adding form a working commit or not

Say I want a single giant commit that, when applied on top of master, will change it to mybranch, basically a patch, for purpouse of later rebasing this one giant commit into a sensible history (because the history for mybranch is a mess).

2014-09-01 16:34:53	andres	Hi. Is there a convenient way for this: I have version 1 of some patch. Review it. Somebody sends me version 2. What I'd like to know is the difference between both so I don't need to read the whole thing again.
2014-09-01 16:35:17	Seveas	regedit: ask the owner of the repo to provide a tarball.
2014-09-01 16:35:30	Seveas	regedit: though why is the repo failing?
2014-09-01 16:35:44	regedit	it's not on GitHub, it's some client's hosting server
2014-09-01 16:35:55	regedit	i think the repo pack files are too big or something
2014-09-01 16:36:04	regedit	error: pack-objects died of signal
2014-09-01 16:36:04	andres	I obviously can take the tre with v1 applied, reset before the patch, apply patch v2, and then diff the two trees. But is there something easier? I'd wondered about a git reset variant that only resets the working tree, but that doesn't seem to exist.
2014-09-01 16:36:18	regedit	error: git upload-pack: git-pack-objects died with error.
2014-09-01 16:36:28	Seveas	andres: what you're looking for is an interdiff. Try the instructions in https://www.drupal.org/documentation/git/interdiff (first google hit for git interdiff)

2014-09-01 18:50:44	clarkk	osse: I agree with you. It's just that, the files were not listed by git status, even though there were other files in that directory that were. The reason for this is that the directory coincidentally had the same name as a directory that was being ignored in the root of the
2014-09-01 18:50:44	clarkk	project. Adding a forward slash in front of the gitignore pattern made git status list it, which is what I was after

2014-09-02 22:23:57	LBV_User	navetz: `it doesn`t update` is quite vague... you want it to update the HEAD of the submodule in current branch or what

2014-09-09 13:00:57	@gitinfo	[!eekaconflict] Merge conflicts are a natural part of collaboration. When facing one, *don't panic*. Read "How to resolve conflicts" in man git-merge and http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-2.html#Basic-Merge-Conflicts then carefully go through the conflicts. Picking one side verbatim is not always the right choice! A nice video explaining merge conflicts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz7NuSCH6II

2014-09-10 16:44:08	@gitinfo	[!fetchfour] [pre 1.8.4 only] We recommend against using 'git fetch/pull <remote> <refspec>' (i.e. with branch argument), because it doesn't update the <remote>/<branch> ref. The easy way to fetch things properly is to get everything: 'git fetch' or 'git pull' are sufficient if you have one remote; otherwise we recommend 'git fetch <remote>' (plus 'git merge <remote>/<branch>' if you wanted to pull/merge).

2014-09-10 19:06:39	ajustrun	oh no i didnt
2014-09-10 19:06:45	ajustrun	25mb is a geo db

2014-09-10 19:09:00	cbreak	if you use a file:// path or an other non-local path it will recompress it

2014-09-11 21:30:42	Geo	Hi, this may be the wrong place- I'm using gitlab as a UI (not sure if thats relevant or not). Someone has submitted a large merge request, and I'd like to pick and choose the commits from it to merge. Example: the request has 6 commits, ABCDEF. I'd like to merge A, C, and D as one commit, then B, E, and F as another. Is that (somehow) possible?

2014-09-11 21:33:51	@gitinfo	Geo: Graphical user interfaces are not supported here. If you want to get support, it needs to be through the git CLI. Reasons: 1) Because very few people here use the graphical interface. 2) Because giving instructions for GUI's is difficult. 3) The command line gives you a history of what commands you have executed.

2014-09-13 12:35:31	+Eugene	!master
2014-09-13 12:35:31	@gitinfo	[!master_branch] 'master' is the default name for the first branch commited by git, and it is in no way special. You can just delete it, and use more meaningful names such as 'dev' 'stable' 'unstable' 'bug/001' etc. If this is a bare repo, you will want to change the default branch(`git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/somebranch`) first.
2014-09-13 12:35:50	gvdm	can I have "git remote add testing url"
2014-09-13 12:35:53	+Eugene	Similarly, "origin" is the default branch name used by `git clone`

2014-09-13 12:37:24	gvdm	and when I push, why do the files not get put into a .git directory?
2014-09-13 12:37:47	+Eugene	What're you pushing to? Is it a !bare repo?
2014-09-13 12:37:47	@gitinfo	an explanation of bare and non-bare repositories (and why pushing to a non-bare one causes problems) can be found here: http://bare-vs-nonbare.gitrecipes.de/
2014-09-13 12:38:13	gvdm	yes
2014-09-13 12:38:17	gvdm	it is bare
2014-09-13 12:38:19	Seveas	gvdm: when you push, the receiving git-receive-pack instance can store things any way it wants. If it's normal git, it's most liekly going into a repo.git bare repository.

2014-09-13 14:48:19	ianbrandt	Greetings.  I have a pending commit where git status shows a file as both modified and renamed to another file, when in fact the other file is a new file that I’m adding (albeit with the same name): "modified: A/file.xml", and "renamed: A/file.xml -> B/file.xml".  Is this just an artifact of the rename detection algorithm that can be safely ignored?  The new file (110 lines) has 15 lines in common with the existing file (46 lines).  M

2014-09-13 20:22:09	geri	hu?
2014-09-13 20:22:12	gfixler	that will just put a second name where you are right now to pin it down
2014-09-13 20:22:19	gfixler	because master is about to move

2014-09-13 21:06:34	@gitinfo	nerder: hi! I'd like to automatically welcome you to #git, a place full of helpful gits. Got a question? Just ask it — chances are someone will answer fairly soon. The topic has links with more information about git and this channel. NB. it can't hurt to do a backup (type !backup for help) before trying things out, especially if they involve dangerous keywords such as --hard, clean, --force/-f, rm and so on.

2014-09-14 15:41:15	Vampire0	Padawan, usually you use "git add ." to add all, which tells git to add the current dir and all beneath. "git add *" is expanded by the shell and there e. g. things starting with "." are missing then

2014-09-14 15:42:14	bddy	Hello. If I did push to origin and saw message that push was successful. And then I told my buddy to do pull. Is it possible that he didn't pull my commits because they were still arriving?
2014-09-14 15:42:15	styx_	Padawan: rm -rf .git
2014-09-14 15:42:25	bddy	Or it depends?
2014-09-14 15:43:07	Vampire0	bddy, I don't think so. When you see that the push was successful, the push should be finished
2014-09-14 15:43:20	Vampire0	bddy, maybe you didn't push what you think you pushed?
2014-09-14 15:43:43	Vampire0	bddy, are there more than one branch and you pushed only one while your buddy is looking for another branch?
2014-09-14 15:44:43	bddy	Vampire0: No, that was an abstract question. Probably there is a bug in our build bot. (I called build bot a buddy for simplicity)

Diffing with --ignore-all-space takes care of most of my needs, but I haven't been able to find a setting to ignore line breaks. By this I mean stuff like moving a function opening bracket that has been on the same line to the next one. Is there a setting that would ignore this?

Am I right that if let's say I have 3 features to finish, I'll complete those 3 features first before I make a release branch? I was thinking it would be so much work if I make a release for every feature

2014-09-15 17:54:26	queuetip	we use a fairly standard git flow at work, and one of my coworkers merged into the development branch a bunch of stuff that wasn't supposed to go. i thought git reset --hard HEAD~1 would have fixed it / removed it all together, but it seemed to skip over the merge and reset it back further than i wanted. suggestions on how to fix this?
