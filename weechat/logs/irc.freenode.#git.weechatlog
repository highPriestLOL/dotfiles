2014-08-26 18:18:04	MestreLion	I could cherry pick with --no-commit, and then slice the changes using `add -p`... but since all the changes would be in my working tree already, it would be hard to tell if the bits I'm adding form a working commit or not

2014-08-29 00:14:00	diegoaguilar	locally, should I have two copies of the file corresponding to both branches?
2014-08-29 00:15:02	diegoaguilar	they're actually text files after all ... how can I manage to edit a probably totally distinct file for different branches?
