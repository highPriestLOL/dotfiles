2014-11-06 22:35:55	IAmLegend	`live ISmithers
2014-11-06 22:36:00	IAmLegend	ugh whats the thing
2014-11-06 22:36:03	IAmLegend	`live
2014-11-06 22:36:03	Selvvir	IAmLegend, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code or images alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.
2014-11-06 22:36:12	b1nar1	hi
