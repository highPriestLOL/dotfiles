2014-08-23 21:19:14	joe9	In C programming language, when using signal handlers, the recommended action is to set a flag and execute an action in the main loop using that flag. How would that translate to haskell programming with signal handlers. Haskell does not have the concept of global flags. Should I just execute the action in the signal handler?

2014-08-23 21:20:56	slack1256	the other is that in your main loop you do `catch` for UserError (that include some signals)
