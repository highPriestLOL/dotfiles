2014-08-23 21:49:15	voxadam	Occasionally I run as root for a few using sudo -i just to make it so I don't have to type sudo every time I want to switch into a directory or tail a log file. Would it be a bad idea to source my personal zshrc automatically as root? Is there a better way to use the config that I'm used to while logged in as root?
2014-08-23 21:53:54	nath_schwarz	voxadam: If it's a personal system there is no point in not using your personal rc (I actually have symlinked the regarding files [however it still depends on what you have written in your rc]). If it's a corporate system you might want to set up an rc file for the root user only.
