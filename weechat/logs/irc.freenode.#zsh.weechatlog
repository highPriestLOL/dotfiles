2014-08-23 21:49:15	voxadam	Occasionally I run as root for a few using sudo -i just to make it so I don't have to type sudo every time I want to switch into a directory or tail a log file. Would it be a bad idea to source my personal zshrc automatically as root? Is there a better way to use the config that I'm used to while logged in as root?
2014-08-23 21:53:54	nath_schwarz	voxadam: If it's a personal system there is no point in not using your personal rc (I actually have symlinked the regarding files [however it still depends on what you have written in your rc]). If it's a corporate system you might want to set up an rc file for the root user only.

2014-10-03 14:34:27	Mikachu	that's a bit vague
2014-10-03 14:34:42	frew	like
2014-10-03 14:34:48	frew	I have 30 options

2014-10-03 14:35:02	frew	so I was wanting to put a linebreak between each set
2014-10-03 14:35:31	Mikachu	i think so, assuming you have completion descriptions enabled
2014-10-03 14:35:42	Mikachu	just make three separate arrays

2014-10-03 14:36:20	frew	ah ok
2014-10-03 14:36:25	frew	I didn't try hard enough ;)
2014-10-03 14:36:30	Mikachu	if that doesn't work, you can just invoke _describe three times
2014-10-03 14:36:38	frew	oh good call
2014-10-03 14:37:17	Mikachu	this isn't really an issue in this case since you have hardcoded values, but you should check the return value of all completer helper functions, and if any of them return 0 you return 0, and if they all return 1, you return 1
2014-10-03 14:37:33	Mikachu	traditionally we set local ret=1 at the start of a completer and put && ret=0 after everything that might add matches
2014-10-03 14:37:44	Mikachu	that way, compsys knows if you added any matches
2014-10-03 14:38:08	Mikachu	and eg, if it should proceed to the next completer or not (which might be _correct or something)

2014-10-11 18:36:43	Mikachu	ah, it does work with globcomplete set if you use ^I as complete-word instead of expand-or-complete and put _expand before _complete in the completer style
2014-10-11 18:36:51	Mikachu	(the c*/**/pf* variant)
2014-10-11 18:38:17	Mikachu	ah, if you put _expand in completer, compinit automatically binds tab to complete-word instead of expand-or-complete

2014-10-13 20:04:57	lnong	Guys, i'm not sure why rxvt-unicode and uxterm aren't displaying unicode chars properly, instead it spits a square. :-\ The locale is set to .utf-8 and it works perfectly fine in gnome-terminal.
2014-10-13 20:05:28	lnong	I've tried googling and almost all results are pointing towards locale generation.
2014-10-13 20:05:57	lnong	Locale is correct, though.
2014-10-13 20:06:14	[arx]	using the same font between the terminals?
2014-10-13 20:06:36	lnong	[arx]: yes.

2014-10-13 20:19:40	Mikachu	if you had a bogus locale, it would be more likely to show the wrong characters rather than squares
2014-10-13 20:19:50	lnong	i see.
2014-10-13 20:20:22	lnong	Mikachu: so you mean i should test it with "Monospace" the default fallback font, first?
2014-10-13 20:20:31	lnong	i mean, do you suggest?
2014-10-13 20:20:50	Mikachu	what kind of glyphs are you trying to display?

2014-10-24 16:01:14	Mikachu	what background process?
2014-10-24 16:01:28	Mikachu	you register a handler, and when there is input available you read it and print it
2014-10-24 16:01:33	Mikachu	there is no background process
2014-10-24 16:01:48	CcxCZ	something that reads the IrcIt logs, in webstrand's case

2014-10-24 17:34:44	CcxCZ	or rather look into my last paste how to collect all outstanding lines in the buffer
2014-10-24 17:35:10	mafro	I’ve been wrting some of my old utility scripts into ~/.zsh-functions/* and then using autoload to load them in zshrc
2014-10-24 17:35:27	mafro	problem I have is - getopt doesn’t work anymore in this model
2014-10-24 17:35:36	mafro	how do you do getopt type stuff in zsh?
2014-10-24 17:35:36	webstrand	CcxCZ: It still continuously prints. Perhaps my read is different from yours, I cant find documentation on the -t flag

2014-10-24 17:43:44	mafro	line 7: options: attempt to set slice of associative array
2014-10-24 17:44:12	mafro	I was guessing there might be different pattern to using getopts in zsh
2014-10-24 17:44:13	osse	mafro: you stumbled upon a name for a variable that zsh itself uses
2014-10-24 17:44:23	mafro	ugh that old chestnut
2014-10-24 17:44:45	mafro	osse: thanks dude!  - so what is options (whilst we’re here)?
2014-10-24 17:45:23	osse	mafro: an associative array (surprise!) of all the options the shell has and whether they're set or not
2014-10-24 17:45:30	osse	as with 'setopt off'
2014-10-24 17:45:33	osse	ugh
2014-10-24 17:45:35	osse	setopt foo
2014-10-24 17:45:47	mafro	ah right I see

2014-10-30 20:52:34	blueyed	How can I debug/show the completion function for a given prefix, e.g. there's a specific completion after "base16_scheme", but I cannot see where it is coming from.

2014-10-30 21:11:12	c74d	How might I, in a `preexec` function, get the first word of the command to be executed ($2), without including any pre-command modifiers?
2014-10-30 21:11:43	c74d	E.g., getting 'foo' when running '! foo bar baz'.
2014-10-30 21:12:30	c74d	Would the best way be just taking $2 and stripping any '!', 'command', etc. from the front?
2014-10-30 21:12:53	blueyed	Mikachu: _complete_help (^Xh) appears to do nothing for this prefix, but for "ls". _complete_debug (^X?) _is_ heavy.
2014-10-30 21:13:10	blueyed	Why is there ""^X" self-insert" from "bindkey -v"?

2014-10-30 21:15:05	blueyed	This is the output from _complete_debug: http://dpaste.com/1E58C55
2014-10-30 21:15:56	blueyed	First, I've commented the line that does "compadd /home/daniel/.dotfiles/lib/base16/base16-shell/*.sh:)t:r:s/base16-/)", and then I'm wondering why it appears to remove ".light" from the end.
2014-10-30 21:17:26	blueyed	Ok - forget the "removing .light part", that's correct.
2014-10-30 21:17:42	blueyed	But I wonder why the completion is still there although commented.
2014-10-30 21:23:20	blueyed	Ok. I've removed ~/.zcomp* and now it does not get used anymore, but I cannot make it work as well again.
2014-10-30 21:23:27	blueyed	Should this work? compdef "compadd $BASE16_SHELL_DIR/*.sh:)t:r:s/base16-/)" base16_scheme
2014-10-30 21:24:09	Mikachu	that looks very unbalanced
2014-10-30 21:26:08	blueyed	Ok.. what I basically want is to complete from a given set of files (modified).
2014-10-30 21:26:19	Mikachu	you have two ) but no (
2014-10-30 21:26:52	blueyed	oh, that appears to be a paste error: compdef "compadd $BASE16_SHELL_DIR/*.sh:)t:r:s/base16-/)" base16_scheme
2014-10-30 21:27:04	blueyed	again. how odd.
2014-10-30 21:27:14	Mikachu	base16_scheme is a command?
2014-10-30 21:27:37	blueyed	the first closing one is an opening one.
2014-10-30 21:27:41	Mikachu	c74d: i think so, it's not a set of words that's likely to change a lot
2014-10-30 21:28:08	Mikachu	do you have a script that changes (: to :)?
2014-10-30 21:28:42	blueyed	Mikachu: probably - I am using weechat, but am not left-handed.. ;)
2014-10-30 21:31:12	Mikachu	did you see my other question?

2014-11-03 19:29:34	dsrguru	is this right btw that completion refers to the general system of generating lists of possible things you meant and then expansion refers specifically to the act of substituting them into the command-line and selection refers specifically to filtering those completion results through a menu rather than throw them onto the command-line?
2014-11-03 19:30:46	dsrguru	as in, is the functionality I desire simply replacing expand-or-complete with just complete-word?

2014-11-03 19:32:50	dsrguru	it would seem the answer is yes. I decided to r section 6.1 of tfm and it was surprisingly intelligible :)

2014-11-03 19:33:25	osse	expansion also refers to stuff like  $var  and  $(cmd)

2014-11-03 19:35:06	SweetieBot	[arx]: ansible, y u no wok?
2014-11-03 19:35:32	Mikachu	dsrguru: the completion system is very configurable (some might spell that "complicated")
2014-11-03 19:35:55	Mikachu	you can do expansion in multiple ways, either inside or outside the completion system
2014-11-03 19:36:20	Mikachu	i think expand-or-complete does "core" expansion, but putting _expand in your completers and using complete-word does compsys expansion which lets you pick one thinger
2014-11-03 19:36:32	Mikachu	that is at least correct on some level, but maybe not every detail
2014-11-03 19:45:24	dsrguru	makes sense
