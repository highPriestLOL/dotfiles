2015-04-01 19:36:48	Erlkoenig	also "blocking" does not mean "slow"; it means a function (typically an I/O function) waits for an operation to complete and returns after that. This can slow down your program because it can't do any other calculations in that time (which is essentially wasted for waiting), unless you use multithreading.

2015-04-01 19:37:52	faioewjfiaowej	i think there's a problem with the get line function being used in a thread, especially when the input is very very large volume
2015-04-01 19:38:44	Erlkoenig	line based I/O is probably not a good idea with very very large volumes...

2015-04-01 19:41:03	Erlkoenig	what about using a proper debugger such as GDB
2015-04-01 19:41:07	faioewjfiaowej	i'm still attempting to diagnose it, but i think that the volume of data is screwing it up
2015-04-01 19:41:28	Erlkoenig	just reading lots of data is not a problem, but if you store it in RAM it might be
2015-04-01 19:41:39	Erlkoenig	also, reading one line at a time is probably slow.
2015-04-01 19:41:52	Erlkoenig	why don't you read blocks of, say, 8 MBytes at a time
2015-04-01 19:42:14	faioewjfiaowej	so there's a possibility that due to the volume, this blocking get line isn't reading fast enough and my RAM is filling up faster than can be processed by it?
