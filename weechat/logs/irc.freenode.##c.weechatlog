2014-08-31 14:20:51	Wulf	SaEeDIRHA: probably, but C does not specify the syntax of inline assembly.
2014-08-31 14:20:52	calleerlandsson	Mainly task related data. Some strings, some dates, some integers.

2014-08-31 14:21:47	calleerlandsson	Every file should represent a task. A task has many fields, like title and due_date and so on.
2014-08-31 14:21:52	Chris	I suggest, as Wulf kind of did, you use plain text. Compress if necessary.

2014-08-31 22:46:31	twkm	the llvm documentation most likely, specifically the part on linking.
2014-08-31 22:46:54	sha0	augur: I thought you were asking about fields of structs or unions called 'a', until you shared that error.
2014-08-31 22:47:06	twkm	in summary: providers must follow consumers, and if that means specifying the library multiple times so be it.
2014-08-31 22:47:08	augur	oh now hah, sorry sha0 :)
2014-08-31 22:47:46	augur	no*

2014-08-31 22:48:19	augur	twkm: hm. but the error i dont think is related to that.
2014-08-31 22:48:55	augur	so the structure of the .a is like this:   outer.a/foo.o   outer.a/inner.a/bar.o
2014-08-31 22:49:12	twkm	normally the symbol table is discarded once a library has provided what is currently needed.
2014-08-31 22:49:14	augur	if i flatten this to just   outer.a/foo.o  outer.a/bar.o   it compiles fine
2014-08-31 22:49:34	twkm	oh, nested a library in a library.  don't even go there.

2014-09-01 08:28:50	emperiz	Do you use C for larger software projects? And if so, do you have a code base (besides the std lib of course), which you use for common tasks? Are you writing your own abstraction layers (e.g. via structs)?

2014-09-01 08:33:29	Cotillion	emperiz: in the real world people don't usually use C, except to make OSes, or low level libraries, they use higher level languages that interface with C directly or indirectly
2014-09-01 08:33:37	Cotillion	C exist only for those things, or embedded stuff
2014-09-01 08:34:03	emperiz	edk: Smaller in the sense of libs or single algorithms.
2014-09-01 08:34:28	edk	Cotillion: that's not strictly true
2014-09-01 08:34:39	Cotillion	not strictly of course, but often it's true
2014-09-01 08:34:55	Cotillion	people rarely write a complete program in C, C is used to define low level stuff, and as an interface to other languages
2014-09-01 08:34:57	edk	a statement about what people generally do is either true or wrong
2014-09-01 08:35:06	Cotillion	right, I have expressed myself incorrectly then
2014-09-01 08:35:32	Cotillion	regardless, your question is language agnostic emperiz , the same principles apply for any language
2014-09-01 08:36:02	edk	emperiz: i write a whole bunch of things. i do a decent amount of embedded work, that's usually all in C and will have abstraction layers where they seem useful
2014-09-01 08:37:09	edk	i try to do things like map the stdio to my io abstraction layer, so printf and friends will automatically send their output over an appropriate debugging serial terminal

2014-09-01 08:39:52	emperiz	Thanks for your answers. Not that it was a very important question, it was just that I wasn't sure whether to use C or higher level languages for which case. I'm missing the experience.

2014-09-01 08:42:50	Cotillion	depends on what type of videogames
2014-09-01 08:42:56	orbitz	if you mean the next gen 3d shooter, then that will likley need to be written in C++ just because the surroundign culture and tooling and performance opportunites c++ offers

2014-09-01 11:03:03	cousteau	also, "passing by pointer" is 2 characters shorter than "passing by reference"

2014-09-01 11:06:56	cousteau	"pass by reference" is when you can pass a variable as an argument, modify the argument within the function, and have the variable that was passed to the function be modified as a side effect
2014-09-01 11:07:12	cousteau	(one could say this is the case for function-like macros)
2014-09-01 11:08:32	cousteau	and (macros aside) in C that doesn't happen as all the arguments of a function are evaluated and a copy of their values is passed to the function, so the original element is not modified
2014-09-01 11:09:13	cousteau	the behavior of pass by reference can be achieved by using pointers though

2014-09-01 13:35:02	cousteau	but having the code reflect what you mean is important
2014-09-01 13:35:38	cousteau	also, with [][] you can refer to rows of the matrix alone.  You can say matrix[3] meaning all the row matrix[3][...]
2014-09-01 13:35:55	cousteau	which could be useful if you want to pass a row to ...something

2014-09-02 22:03:48	candide	Undefined behavior is behavior for which the C standard does not impose any requirements. This is to allow C the freedom to be implemented on various systems that do not share the same architecture. Programs invoking undefined behavior may appear to compile and even run without errors at first, only to fail on another system, or even at a later time. If you want to write reliable code, don't use such behaviors.

2014-09-02 22:08:35	edk	Autumnal: suppose you access some uninitialized memory. (which is also undefined behaviour). would you expect to get the same nonsense each time?
2014-09-02 22:08:38	Autumnal	Xgc: Because I said they're deterministic? They are...
2014-09-02 22:09:13	edk	Autumnal: it is technically deterministic which nonsense you get, but it may be impossible to predict with the information available
2014-09-02 22:09:19	Xgc	Autumnal: You have an odd understanding of reality and computers.
2014-09-02 22:09:25	Autumnal	edk: Haha, no... but that only APPEARS random because of my ignorance of the entire state of my memory. It's not actually random.
2014-09-02 22:10:21	edk	actually, if your computer has a HRNG, it could actually be random - your implementation could notice that you're invoking UB and use the HRNG to generate result data
2014-09-02 22:10:29	Xgc	Autumnal: Tell me how you expect to duplicate behavior at a different point in time?  The fact is, as much as you might attempt to duplicate the behavior, you can't.  It's not possible.
2014-09-02 22:10:33	edk	which would be a bit weird, but entirely legal according to C
2014-09-02 22:10:35	Autumnal	edk: I agree, but in the case of this specific example of i = i++, I'm not accessing uninitialised memory or any other source of seemingly random data, so the program should always return i=0, even if that result is meaningless to me.

2014-09-02 22:12:38	Xgc	Autumnal: So, you eventually understand that physical systems never ebhave the same way twice in a row.  Now you may not notice the differences or you may.  In terms of program behavior, you might have a race condition or any number of issues that can cause one run to behave differently than another, even if you attempt to provide the same input.
2014-09-02 22:13:11	Pentium44	CaZe, 6?

2014-09-02 22:14:45	Autumnal	Xgc: Race condition?
2014-09-02 22:14:46	CaZe	Maybe he ran it through his compiler and it unrolled the loop.

2014-09-02 22:16:41	edk	e.g. if you make a thread that tries to set foo to 3 and another that tries to set it to 4, and start those threads at roughly the same time
2014-09-02 22:17:23	edk	depending on which thread executes faster, foo might end up being 3 or 4, or get corrupted if they hit it at the same time

2014-09-03 23:45:52	dorp	Theoretically speaking, a webserver that doesn't utilize any form of threading, would be very limited?

2014-09-10 11:38:53	ddvlad	Heh, I remember my professor advising that instead of using pointer-to-pointer-to-type arguments for functions, we should just save as C++ and use a reference to a pointer.  Double indirections confused him.

2014-09-10 11:53:49	Shayanjm	cousteau: I'd say that's EE, or ME depending on the application/'hardware'
2014-09-10 11:53:50	cousteau	Shayanjm, in gcc, compile with -g and then use gdb
2014-09-10 11:53:54	CJKay	cousteau: Electrical engineering
2014-09-10 11:54:18	cousteau	Shayanjm, hardware as in digital electronics and not as in a hammer, so EE
2014-09-10 11:54:30	CJKay	Shayanjm: Segfaults are caused when you try to access memory you didn't allocate or have permission to access
2014-09-10 11:54:47	cousteau	but I like the "hardware engineering" term as a counterpart to "software engineering"

2014-09-10 11:58:34	CJKay	That doesn't make any sense
2014-09-10 11:58:42	Shayanjm	I guess I have no idea what you mean by that
2014-09-10 11:58:42	cousteau	no, it'd be dereferencing something and getting false
2014-09-10 11:58:48	CJKay	Dereferencing is following a pointer
2014-09-10 11:58:54	Shayanjm	correct
2014-09-10 11:59:10	cousteau	CJKay meant "when that thing you're adding a ! to returns false, you're dereferencing something"
2014-09-10 11:59:18	CJKay	If you had a pointer to string[strlen(string)] then you should probably get '\0'

2014-09-10 13:29:35	CaZe	Well, you could answer the question I asked a few lines up.

2014-09-10 13:34:30	Shayanjm	I believe the core issue is "how do you go from a pointer in a char array, to the index of that pointer in the array?"
2014-09-10 13:34:31	CaZe	Shayanjm: Try adding a new variable to your function that counts how many times that while loop is run.

2014-09-10 14:47:11	pragma-	I choose the female model myself because if I have to play a 3rd person view game where I have to stare at a model all the time, I'd like it to be a nice pretty female instead of a manly hulk.

2014-09-10 16:46:12	dioo	Hi, I have a question: I know that VMS uses a "weird" convention where programs returning 1 exit succesfully (instead of the common 0). Hence, it is better to use exit(EXIT_SUCCESS) instead of exit(0). But what about the return code of main()? 0 is defined to be conformant (for historical reasons IIRC)?
2014-09-10 16:48:53	dioo	Nevermind, of course Stack Overflow already answered this one (silly me)

2014-09-10 19:44:42	fizzie	It's arguably easier to do the constant-time queue, and it's very easy to make no explicit size limits. In fact, it's probably harder to have a maximum size limit than not.

2014-09-10 19:45:37	fizzie	Also, returning an int * from something like stackPop is slightly dubious. Cf. results from  int *top = stackPop(s); stackPush(s, 42); printf("what we popped was %d", *top);  -- at the very least, the documentation should emphasize how ephemeral the pointer is.
2014-09-10 19:46:24	fizzie	(I assume it's done like that to make it possible to return NULL for an empty stack, but still.)

2014-09-10 19:51:04	fizzie	You could just have it return an int and declare that it returns an unspecified value if popping an empty stack. From the caller's point of view, there's not that much difference in doing  int *top = stackPop(s); if (top) doSomethingWith(*top); else ohNo();  vs. doing  if (!isStackEmpty(s)) doSomethingWith(stackPop(s)); else ohNo();  since it needs to be tested for in any case.

2014-09-10 20:44:09	fizzie	Going by what you said (rather than what's in the image), in "tk->string - strstr(tk->string, tk->delim)" tk->string is presumably a char *, and strstr also returns a char *, and their subtraction is an integer.
2014-09-10 20:45:33	fizzie	While what fstd described was your "this is valid" variant, and it differs exactly because one is "char * minus an integer" and the other is "char * minus another char *".

2014-09-11 20:30:17	Chris	lf is more invalid stuff.
2014-09-11 20:30:31	maxwellwood	interesting
2014-09-11 20:30:51	Chris	A float's possible values is guaranteed to be a subset of double's possible values.
2014-09-11 20:31:10	Chris	The sizes are implementation dependent, but IEEE754 is common which makes double twice the precision as float.
2014-09-11 20:31:30	Chris	3.0 is a double, 3.0f is a float, 3.0Lf is a long double.
2014-09-11 20:31:33	maxwellwood	i have no idea what that means.
2014-09-11 20:31:36	Chris	,cc 3.0Lf
2014-09-11 20:31:38	candide	Chris: error: invalid suffix "Lf" on floating constant
2014-09-11 20:31:44	maxwellwood	so why use float when you can use double?
2014-09-11 20:31:46	Chris	Disregard the last part.
2014-09-11 20:31:58	Chris	Because floats often take up half the space.
2014-09-11 20:32:03	Chris	If you have an array of a billion of them you might care.
2014-09-11 20:32:10	maxwellwood	okay, so less memory.
2014-09-11 20:32:37	Chris	Operations on floats also might be faster on some systems.
2014-09-11 20:32:45	maxwellwood	okay, so lets say i want a integer in the printf(), i do printf("%i",5);
2014-09-11 20:32:46	Chris	That's something you have to profile per use-case.
2014-09-11 20:32:54	Chris	Sure.
2014-09-11 20:32:55	maxwellwood	what is the %letter for a double?
2014-09-11 20:33:19	Chris	%f
2014-09-11 20:33:24	maxwellwood	O.O
2014-09-11 20:33:28	maxwellwood	then whats a float?
2014-09-11 20:33:40	maxwellwood	(god this makes more sense now)
2014-09-11 20:33:41	Chris	Also %f because it gets promoted to double when passted to a variable argument function like printf.
2014-09-11 20:34:09	maxwellwood	so by promoted, you mean casted? (as i would call it, being someone who learned java first)
2014-09-11 20:34:51	Chris	No.
2014-09-11 20:34:56	maxwellwood	no?
2014-09-11 20:35:05	Chris	"casting" in C means an explicit conversion. As in, (int)42.0
2014-09-11 20:35:11	Chris	Promotion is implicit.
2014-09-11 20:35:54	maxwellwood	how do you mean its explicit?
2014-09-11 20:37:06	CaZe	maxwellwood: Are you sure you understand what casting means in Java?
2014-09-11 20:37:07	Chris	Hmm, is English not your native language?
2014-09-11 20:37:24	Chris	(int)42.0 -- explicit because you meantion _explicitly_ the type you want to convert to.
2014-09-11 20:37:29	Chris	er.. mention.
2014-09-11 20:37:35	maxwellwood	yes, it is my native language, im just not following :P
2014-09-11 20:37:56	maxwellwood	and i THINK i know what casting is in java. in java my understanding is that its basically converting one data type to another, is that incorrect?

2014-09-11 20:38:17	CaZe	See the "Casting Objects" section.
2014-09-11 20:38:39	maxwellwood	i'm not seeing how inheritance has to do with casting (forgive my ignorance)
2014-09-11 20:38:53	maxwellwood	okay
2014-09-11 20:38:58	Chris	But let's not discuss Java here.
2014-09-11 20:38:59	CaZe	For example, if we write
2014-09-11 20:39:00	CaZe	Object obj = new MountainBike();
2014-09-11 20:39:03	Chris	Please.
2014-09-11 20:39:03	CaZe	then obj is both an Object and a MountainBike (until such time as obj is assigned another object that is not a MountainBike). This is called implicit casting.
2014-09-11 20:39:26	CaZe	However, we can tell the compiler that we promise to assign a MountainBike to obj by explicit casting:
2014-09-11 20:39:29	CaZe	MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike)obj;
2014-09-11 20:39:33	Chris	Stop.
2014-09-11 20:39:40	Chris	maxwellwood: double x = 3; // implicit conversion.
2014-09-11 20:39:56	Chris	maxwellwood: double x = (double)3; // casting, an explicit, redundant, conversion.
2014-09-11 20:40:07	CaZe	They call it "implicit casting", whereas the analogous concept in C is called "implicit conversion".

2014-09-11 20:43:21	maxwellwood	okay i believe i understand
2014-09-11 20:43:27	Chris	Nirvana's second studio album isn't relevant here.
2014-09-11 20:43:45	maxwellwood	now, what do you mean the float gets "promoted"
2014-09-11 20:44:18	Chris	It's a quirk of C. floats get "promoted" to doubles when passed to printf because printf is variable argument -- int printf(const char *, ...);
2014-09-11 20:44:45	Chris	It's called a promotion because a double can represent all the values of float and potentially more.
2014-09-11 20:44:56	maxwellwood	(sorry for so many questions but...) what is a "variable argument"
2014-09-11 20:45:08	maxwellwood	okay, that makes sense (the promotion)
2014-09-11 20:45:14	Chris	A function that can take a variable number of arguments, like printf.
2014-09-11 20:45:23	Chris	The argument types aren't explicitly defined.
2014-09-11 20:45:27	Chris	(apart from the first one)
2014-09-11 20:45:43	maxwellwood	again, to compare to java, is that like have overloaded methods, with different variable types as the parameter?
2014-09-11 20:45:47	Chris	No.
2014-09-11 20:45:55	maxwellwood	:S
2014-09-11 20:46:03	Chris	C doesn't have function argument overloading. It has something more insidious.
2014-09-11 20:46:22	Chris	And if C _did_ have function argument overloading, you couldn't solve printf with that, as printf can take any combination of types.
2014-09-11 20:46:32	maxwellwood	ah, okay
2014-09-11 20:46:52	Chris	(you would need to write int printf(const char *, double); int printf(const char *, int); int printf(const char *, int, double, char *, void *); ...
2014-09-11 20:46:54	maxwellwood	what does it have instead?
2014-09-11 20:47:13	Chris	As I said, it uses the variable argument feature. Feel free to look it up in a C book.
2014-09-11 20:47:16	maxwellwood	(of overloading)
2014-09-11 20:47:20	Chris	It doesn't.
2014-09-11 20:47:23	maxwellwood	okay.
2014-09-11 20:47:30	Chris	printf's prototype is int printf(const char *, ...);
2014-09-11 20:48:00	Chris	C++ has overloading, FWIW, and it's one of the "features", I'd like to see in C, but it won't happen.
2014-09-11 20:48:31	Chris	I need, to use, less commas.
2014-09-11 20:48:38	maxwellwood	i believe my teacher will switch us over to c++ later this year :P
2014-09-11 20:48:52	Chris	Hilarious.
2014-09-11 20:49:02	Chris	(because it sounds like they're doing a terrible job at C)
2014-09-11 20:49:09	Chris	And C++ is eleventy times more complicated.
2014-09-11 20:49:13	maxwellwood	i dont dissagree

2014-09-11 20:49:28	maxwellwood	my java teacher wasn't better (actually worse)
2014-09-11 20:50:04	maxwellwood	fully from textbook, couldn't help us, he didn't know as much as some of the students in the class
2014-09-11 20:50:12	Chris	C differs from Java in that learning Java poorly is less dangerous than learning C poorly.
2014-09-11 20:50:17	maxwellwood	(thank you google)
2014-09-11 20:50:40	maxwellwood	why is that?
2014-09-11 20:51:00	Chris	Because C has the concept of undefined, unspecified and implementation-defined behavior throughout.
2014-09-11 20:51:20	Chris	So you can happily do stuff in C that is undefined and you [probably] won't get any compiler error and [possibly] no crash, segfault, etc. to indicate you've messed up.
2014-09-11 20:51:38	maxwellwood	i see...

2014-09-21 11:47:05	nitrix	goldess: Function definitions (not to be confused with declarations) needs a compound expression that constitutes the body of the function that'll get executed.
2014-09-21 11:47:36	nitrix	goldess: In most cases, a function is more than one expression, so you'll see a block { } with multiple expressions.

2014-09-21 11:50:11	nitrix	I could say `declaration-specifiers declarator declaration-listopt compound-statement` but he wouldn't understand what I'm talking about.
2014-09-21 11:50:38	edk	or you could have just said the correct thing
2014-09-21 11:50:52	edk	(i.e. what you did say, without the "in most cases" bit)
2014-09-21 11:51:25	Wulf	nitrix: I only wanted to point out that this is invalid:   int func(int a) return a + 3;
2014-09-21 11:51:30	nitrix	That was referring to functions having more than one expressions, which isn't always the case.
2014-09-21 11:51:47	edk	that part was wrong too. functions don't need to have any expressions
2014-09-21 11:52:01	edk	it was just easier than quoting the entire line you said
2014-09-21 11:52:14	nitrix	They just need a compound-statement, I'm well aware.
2014-09-21 11:52:19	nitrix	He's a noob.
2014-09-21 11:52:24	edk	then why did you deliberately explain it wrong?
2014-09-21 11:52:44	nitrix	Because you can't always be pedantic.
2014-09-21 11:52:50	edk	yes i can
2014-09-21 11:52:53	nitrix	The guy barely understands what he's doing.

2014-09-21 11:56:25	nitrix	goldess: Line #16 bothers me. It's possible you aren't comfortable with the language but getMax supposedly takes 4 arguments and you invoked it 3 times with only 2 arguments.

2014-09-21 11:58:21	goldess	nitrik: sleep is a luxury i can't afford atm . to be honest I'm just goggling everything you explain and trying to gain better understanding instead of just plugging stuff in

2014-09-21 22:55:26	marvimias	I'm trying to do my assignment, and in which I have 2 files a header and a standard C file. I've been told to make an array to hold values + a position with a size being the reference for the array. However, it's being done based off a node.
2014-09-21 22:55:39	marvimias	The code is below, I'm wondering how I would go about implementing the array.

Is it possible to do this with a printf format? All I understood is that you can pad any string with spaces up to a fixed field width, but I think that width has to be specified at compile time in a string literal.

2014-09-27 07:48:59	Prochamber	Thank you for your explaination.
2014-09-27 07:49:29	Chris	There's a list of sequence points in Annex C of C11
2014-09-27 07:50:46	Prochamber	Out of curiousity, which version of the C11 standard do you use? Have you purchased the ISO version or do you use the working draft?

2014-09-27 07:51:50	Chris	n1256 is C99
2014-09-27 07:52:36	Chris	Notably, the sequence point explanations between C11 and C99 differ significantly, because C11 added threads so the memory model had to be clarified.

2014-09-27 07:54:08	Chris	I don't know. To answer that question would require a lot of careful analysis.

2014-09-28 08:17:47	zyxwvuts	whereismycar: actually, converting utf-16 to a codepoint is about as simple as: s[0] << 8 | s[1] (or s[0] | s[1] << 8 if little endian), so you probably don't need a library for that. just codepoint -> utf-8 (or you could look into implementing it yourself -- it's not too hard), and the code for handling those codepoints

2014-09-28 22:06:39	candide	Sonny_Jim: NULL is an (implementation-defined) macro expanding to a null pointer constant, which is any zero-value integer constant expression, possibly cast to void *. Such an expression has a special meaning in the context of pointer expressions to, for example, produce null pointers or test if other pointers are null pointers.

2014-10-04 16:38:10	ggVGc	drakored: I'd say it depends on the details of that SDK
2014-10-04 16:38:30	ggVGc	usually documentations include how to deal with pointers being passed around
2014-10-04 16:38:34	ggVGc	how long they are valid etc.
2014-10-04 16:38:38	drakored	johnnyreb: common sense is what tells me the memory could be freed outside of my scope, but lack of knowledge/experience with c is what tells me I should read more
2014-10-04 16:38:45	drakored	hence looking for advice
2014-10-04 16:38:50	johnnyreb	dragored: Trust your common sense :)
2014-10-04 16:38:59	drakored	johnnyreb: thanks for that confirmation :)
2014-10-04 16:39:17	drakored	ggVGc: I haven't seen much on that, but I'll double check their memory management area, thanks!
2014-10-04 16:40:06	johnnyreb	If the pointer is passed in to a function of yours, it should be fine to use it within that function. However, if you want to retain it, you'll have to know what the SDK expects of your code when it passes the pointer to you. :P
2014-10-04 16:40:24	ggVGc	drakored: it also matters what the data is. If the data is something that is only "active" during the calling of you callback, but you need it at some later point, then yes, copy it. But if it's a reference to some long living data like an audio object, then don't
2014-10-04 16:40:28	johnnyreb	e.g. make sure it doesn't free() it out from under you :P
2014-10-04 16:40:36	ggVGc	basically what johnnyreb said

2014-10-04 16:41:16	ggVGc	drakored: you don't necessarily need to copy, even if you need it later. It all depends on what the data is

2014-10-04 16:41:48	drakored	excellent, thanks guys this confirms my thoughts on it
2014-10-04 16:42:17	ggVGc	drakored: but anything passed to you will be safe until you exit the scope, unless you are dealing with concurrency, in which case you would need locks or other practices relating to concurrent programming

2014-10-04 16:55:32	nitrix	ggVGc: Also invalidating any pointers your application might be keeping internally.
2014-10-04 16:55:35	ggVGc	kurahaupo1: for this application I do not need indexing, no
2014-10-04 16:55:35	a1fa	i am getting a compile error, but i cant figure out why - since i didnt touch that line...

2014-10-04 16:55:52	nitrix	ggVGc: If you do not need indexing, then you do not need an array.
2014-10-04 16:56:03	drakored	that's incredibly sad, if you don't know the evolution of the compiler you're using, you probably shouldn't be a "pro" at it
2014-10-04 16:56:27	kurahaupo1	nitrix: doing a bulk copy is a lot faster if it's contiguous memory and not using pointers
2014-10-04 16:56:36	ggVGc	right
2014-10-04 16:56:41	kurahaupo1	ggVGc: do you need to make copies of the whole list?
2014-10-04 16:57:24	johnnyreb	drakored: They must all believe that I'm some weird guy practicing some arcane black magic, especially when I'm working in assembly :P
2014-10-04 16:57:57	nitrix	kurahaupo1: I wasn't talking about that. Removing any element in the middle of the list in his array would force O(n-pos) rewrites to avoid fragmenting the array.
2014-10-04 16:58:00	drakored	johnnyreb: haha, hope they don't ever try to learn embedded coding, they'll be lost
2014-10-04 16:58:15	ggVGc	kurahaupo1: well, there are a few reasons why I want it, but the bottom line is that I want it to be continuous memory and not scattered pointers. I can implement this myself, but I was just wondering if it's already written generically by some library
2014-10-04 16:58:15	nitrix	At which point, you'd doing essentially what operating systems already do with RAM pages and you'd be better off a linked list anyway.
2014-10-04 16:58:30	kurahaupo1	nitrix: I'm talking about storing a linked list inside an array, using the array as the allocation pool instead of malloc/free
2014-10-04 16:58:40	ggVGc	yep
2014-10-04 16:58:44	nitrix	kurahaupo1: Your OS already has an allocation pool.

2014-10-04 16:59:15	ggVGc	I guess I can do the same thing
2014-10-04 16:59:16	ggVGc	again
2014-10-04 16:59:54	nitrix	If you do not need random access, you won't gain any benefit from having your list contained in an array. You're just duplicating what your hosted environment would do for you.

2014-10-04 17:00:12	kurahaupo1	ggVGc: just replace the malloc/free calls with two of your own functions which assign from the array; keep a free list using the same next pointer as the main linked list
2014-10-04 17:00:43	kurahaupo1	ggVGc: but otherwise this is trivial enough that there isn't really any reason to have a "library" do it for you
2014-10-04 17:00:43	nitrix	Linux has memory pages and uses free lists, the same way you would implement it.
2014-10-04 17:00:47	nitrix	You're re-inventing the wheel.
2014-10-04 17:00:50	ggVGc	nitrix: fwiw when dealing with many transformations in game development, you can achieve double or more performance just by keeping data continuous in memory. I.e when doing instancing with many animated models or similar.

2014-10-04 17:04:28	nitrix	ggVGc: You definitively overlooked Linux.

2014-10-04 19:03:11	ashley01	(when I learn it, I want to make sure I know exactly what is going on and not dust anything under the carpet)
2014-10-04 19:03:19	kate`	no. it's not recommended because whoever recommended against it does not know what they're talking about. buy that; learn from it
2014-10-04 19:03:23	ashley01	http://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/Books
2014-10-04 19:03:50	kate`	it does describe an older standard; that's completely irrelevant

2014-10-04 19:04:44	ashley01	oh ok, so if I use K&R 2nd edition as my guide and the latest gcc that I can get from sudo apt-get install gcc, I should be ok?
2014-10-04 19:05:04	kate`	any C compiler will do, really. gcc is fine
2014-10-04 19:05:21	ashley01	gcc is the only one I know of that doesn't involve a clunky IDE, but good to know :)

2014-10-04 19:05:38	edk	most compilers you can invoke via an IDE can also be invoked without said IDE
2014-10-04 19:05:43	ggVGc	gcc is good because it is easily available
2014-10-04 19:05:48	ggVGc	so go with that
2014-10-04 19:05:53	edk	ubiquity does not imply quality
2014-10-04 19:05:55	kate`	beware gcc's default is not to compile C, but rather its own dialect. use -std=c90 and perhaps -Wall -pedantic and such
2014-10-04 19:06:03	ggVGc	edk: nope, but ease of access means a lot for learning
2014-10-04 19:06:18	edk	ggVGc: it may well be a good choice. it's just not good
2014-10-04 19:06:22	ashley01	its own dialect? what do you mean?
2014-10-04 19:06:32	ggVGc	edk: yeah, I meant a good choice, sorry
2014-10-04 19:06:40	kate`	ggVGc, that doesn't seem to be so relevant here, since ashley01 has access to apt-get
2014-10-04 19:06:53	edk	ashley01: a whole bunch of stuff the gnu people thought was a good idea at the time
2014-10-04 19:07:13	ashley01	oh ok
2014-10-04 19:08:00	ggVGc	well, I personally use gcc primarily because of its ubiquity though, and honestly don't know about many others except ones I've gotten in contact with for specific purposes/platforms
2014-10-04 19:08:15	ggVGc	edk: what compiler would you say is a good C compiler for linux?

2014-10-04 19:08:30	kate`	ggVGc, that's convenient indeed for you. but that has nothing to do with what you said: what's beneficial for somebody learning C
2014-10-04 19:08:57	ggVGc	kate`: same thing is applicable, imo. Learning with a tool that can be found on basically any *nix machine
2014-10-04 19:09:16	ggVGc	kate`: and also has a lot of users on the internet for various compiling problems

2014-10-04 19:10:24	edk	when tendra is working and available on most linuxes, i'll probably recommend that, because it's more or less the polar opposite of gcc: it strictly enforces standards compliance
2014-10-04 19:10:41	edk	which imo is what you want all the time. but particularly when you're learning
2014-10-04 19:10:57	ggVGc	ashley01: honestly, if you were to be on windows, getting visual studio express is a lot easier to get started than trying to use gcc on windows. the msvc compiler can also be used from command line. but I get the impression you are primarily on ubuntu

2014-10-04 19:11:49	ashley01	I've got used to the shell (Terminal on Ubuntu) a bit as well x)

2014-10-04 19:13:09	nurupo	in gdb, when i do "list" it says "../../src/main.c: No such file or directory"

2014-10-11 12:18:03	fizzie	SporkWitch: strtok modifies the string you give it. You can't go through it a second time, because the delimiters have already been replaced by 0s.
2014-10-11 12:18:35	orbitz	and teh problem is taht bar is a char*
2014-10-11 12:18:37	orbitz	not a char
2014-10-11 12:18:56	SporkWitch	fizzie: that would explain it.  so in theory if the first loop is behaving, if i remove that, the second should behave as expected?
2014-10-11 12:19:06	SporkWitch	orbitz: the above compiles, just gets the warning
2014-10-11 12:19:10	fizzie	Well, there's still the problem orbitz mentions.
2014-10-11 12:19:21	fizzie	I'm not sure what you want the array to contain.
2014-10-11 12:19:21	orbitz	SporkWitch: yes, warnings exist for a reason
2014-10-11 12:20:23	SporkWitch	orbitz: yup, and what fizzie said seems like it explains it.  as to why i skip the first input, it's because i use the first for something else in the main program.  i'm trying to narrow down some issues, and the first step was to figure out what was wrong with my array initialization, so i created the test linked
2014-10-11 12:20:45	orbitz	yes, what i pointed out is a distrinct, but still egregious, error
2014-10-11 12:20:52	petervaro	Hi channel! Does anyone have any knowledge of a macro-hack which basically replaces the spaces of the input with underscores? (I'm not interested in compiler-extensions, I need a solution which is at least a C11 compilant)

2014-10-11 12:26:31	petervaro	because you want to use the type as a type elsewhere
2014-10-11 12:26:52	Seabasschan	It's not a type, though. It's a string literal.

2014-10-11 15:57:45	andschwa	sysvalve: similar, hasht_new() demands functions for the hash, key comparison, and free (with defaults if passed NULL :)
2014-10-11 15:57:56	sysvalve	the insert operation called the dup function. If using ints, the duplication function would be just a return param;
2014-10-11 15:58:09	sysvalve	something like that

2014-10-11 16:41:16	drakored	yea, not entirely sure I'm handling that right, but I have 4 strings that are relative to a specific "task"
2014-10-11 16:42:00	drakored	and I'll have an unknown number of the tasks sent from outside input via a callback (part of pebble's api stuff)
2014-10-11 16:42:13	Seabasschan	Strings aren't a type in C; They're values (or rather, sequences of values) that are stored in arrays.
2014-10-11 16:42:21	drakored	char* is what I mean when I say string
2014-10-11 16:42:31	drakored	so really a struct of 4 pointers
2014-10-11 16:42:35	Seabasschan	Right. That's what I figured.
2014-10-11 16:42:58	andschwa	Seabasschan: do you have any resources (links/books/etc.) to point me toward for learning better memory allocation patterns?
2014-10-11 16:44:39	Seabasschan	andschwa: I suggest writing programs that handle large amounts of data (at least 10MB) and using a cache profiler on them. Reducing cache misses is a good exercise.
2014-10-11 16:44:40	SporkWitch	andschwa: pretty sure this is the one my prof recommended: http://www.amazon.com/Pointers-C-Kenneth-Reek/dp/0673999866

2014-10-11 16:47:06	roygbiv	hey all. are there any dangers with using unsigned char * for the string functions like strlen, strncpy, etc?  these strings will have values greater than 127 in them.
2014-10-11 16:47:11	Seabasschan	drakored: It is most sensible to choose data structures based on the types of operations you perform. If you're going to be shifting items around, and the items are large, then a linked list might be appropriate. If the items are small, or you don't plan on shifting them around a lot, then use an array (in conjunction with malloc?).
2014-10-11 16:47:24	Seabasschan	roygbiv: No.
2014-10-11 16:47:26	SporkWitch	andschwa: since you're playing with memory though, can you confirm that the reason i'm getting the wrong values in the first couple rows of my array is NOT an alignment one? http://hastebin.com/mozajikemu.cpp as far as i've been able to find, that's the right way to allocate the memory for a 2d array (in this case, of strings), but for some reason the first couple rows don't have the correct value
2014-10-11 16:47:49	SporkWitch	while the last several rows DO have the correct values.  i think it's in how i'm parsing tokens to put into it, but want to rule out alignment
2014-10-11 16:48:52	Seabasschan	SporkWitch: char (*array)[xDim][yDim] = malloc(sizeof *array);
2014-10-11 16:48:57	drakored	Seabasschan: at this time no sorting, but that could be something I'll tackle in the future, mostly the array is to be used for output to the screens, and potentially a flag added for it being marked complete (allowing ui to somehow reflect is as complete, or not render)
2014-10-11 16:49:05	roygbiv	all righty Seabasschan thank you. i get screenfuls of compiler warnings but i'm just going to disable that particular one.
2014-10-11 16:49:27	Seabasschan	roygbiv: Make sure you cast the unsigned char *s to char *s.
2014-10-11 16:49:44	andschwa	SporkWitch: I saw a few ways to do it when looking it up myself, but I would trust Seabasschan on this one

2014-10-13 13:11:22	s5s	Hi, I'm a bit confused why I can't do this: int *p = {1,2,3,4}; isn't "{1,2,3,4}" an array litteral which will be translated to an array by the compiler (like "a string" is) and then p will point to the array. The mistake I think I'm making is that {1,2,3,4} is not a literal but perhaps an initializer?

2014-10-13 16:04:03	cousteau	you have a pointer (x) and you make it point to an allocated memory able to hold N objects
2014-10-13 16:04:25	cousteau	this is, N times the size of the type x points to
2014-10-13 16:04:35	cousteau	x points to *x
2014-10-13 16:04:37		Seabasschan (~Seabassch@unaffiliated/seabasschan) has joined ##c
2014-10-13 16:04:44	cousteau	and the size of *x is sizeof *x
2014-10-13 16:04:57	cousteau	and N times the size of x is N * sizeof *x
2014-10-13 16:05:09	cousteau	er, and N times the size of *x is N * sizeof *x
2014-10-13 16:05:43	CaZe	I doubt he'll understand that explanation.
2014-10-13 16:05:52	cousteau	so malloc calls typically look like   x = malloc(N * sizeof *x)
2014-10-13 16:06:08	sheilong	cousteau: my doubt is why sizeof *x instead of sizeof(x)
2014-10-13 16:06:13	CaZe	sheilong: What type does the allocated memory hold?
2014-10-13 16:06:16	cousteau	sheilong, x is a pointer
2014-10-13 16:06:28	PoppaVic	..and yet, certain "people" will continue and continue to either write it for him, or keep pretending to teach.
2014-10-13 16:06:33	cousteau	you don't want the size of a pointer, you want the size of an element that pointer points to
2014-10-13 16:06:40	sheilong	CaZe:  size_t type ?
2014-10-13 16:07:03	sheilong	cousteau:  I get it
2014-10-13 16:07:12	CaZe	sheilong: So, you need it to be sizeof (size_t).
2014-10-13 16:07:15	cousteau	and x is a pointer
2014-10-13 16:07:17	sheilong	cousteau:  but why the *x isn't between ()
2014-10-13 16:07:18	CaZe	sheilong: What type is p?
2014-10-13 16:07:26	cousteau	sheilong, because sizeof doesn't need ()
2014-10-13 16:07:32	sheilong	CaZe:  ULLONG
2014-10-13 16:07:36	cousteau	same as you can write -x instead of -(x)
2014-10-13 16:07:42	CaZe	sheilong: Wrong.
2014-10-13 16:07:42	cousteau	or *x instead of *(x)
2014-10-13 16:07:50	Seabasschan	sheilong: If you allocated sizeof x, you're allocating enough memory to store a pointer, rather than the thing being pointed to.
2014-10-13 16:08:16	cousteau	(however the (int) in sizeof (int) does require parentheses, but that's because of (int), not because of sizeof)
2014-10-13 16:08:33	cousteau	in shrot, it's because sizeof is an operator, not a function
2014-10-13 16:09:01	CaZe	sheilong: unsigned long long *p;  /* pointer to elements */

2014-10-13 16:10:11	Seabasschan	It's easier to see if you choose something that is obviously a different size, such as an array of 128 chars. You don't want to allocate sizeof (char *); You want to allocate 128.
2014-10-13 16:10:39	sheilong	CaZe:  unsigned long long
2014-10-13 16:10:46	CaZe	sheilong: Wrong.

2014-10-13 16:44:46	edk	(possibly) unlike sheilong, i am actually capable of communicating without you spelling everything out
2014-10-13 16:44:53	edk	not that i want to stop you if you enjoy it, but it isn't really necessary
2014-10-13 16:45:13	Seabasschan	You would want pid to be a pid_t, and... maybe use fread? %d isn't a suitable format specifier for a pid_t.

2014-10-13 16:46:46	CaZe	sheilong: As for a more thorough explanation of point 1), There isn't a marker at the end of p to tell you when to stop counting the bits. You need to know how many bits there are to know when to stop counting, but if you know how many bits there are, then you don't need to do the actual counting.
2014-10-13 16:47:33	edk	so i'm not going to bother typing my response again, instead i'll talk to people who occasionally say things that are not annoying

2014-10-15 20:40:46	helichopter	Hey guys, I'm trying to tokenize a string. Basically, anything that isn't alphanumeric is a separator. Is there a way for me to tokenize on a whitelist rather than a blacklist? So like instead of doing strtok(string, seps) is there another function like tokenize(string, nonseps) ?

2014-10-18 17:19:39	micros	If a program calls system("sh /script.sh") and a command like cp inside the script.sh fails, then i would assume that the sh command invoked would still return successful and therefore the code returned by system() would indicate a successful return.  Is this a correct assumption, or would a failed shell command somehow get returned by sh?

2014-10-18 17:20:24	DTSCode	also i imagine that would be determined by the current shell
2014-10-18 17:20:29	micros	well, thats the very first problem... system()...
2014-10-18 17:21:00	micros	a shell script is downloaded from a trusted source and invoked...
2014-10-18 17:21:09	PoppaVic	so bad
2014-10-18 17:21:15	micros	however, if something fails inside the script, i would like to know about it... yes, VERY bad.
2014-10-18 17:21:22	kate`	micros, the "sh" there is redundant, by the way
2014-10-18 17:21:44	micros	kate - i know, its only there for illustration.. the shebang is set for the same
2014-10-18 17:22:04	PoppaVic	there is no such thing as redundantly-redundantly-redundant
2014-10-18 17:22:19	micros	so would an error be returned from system() is something in script.sh failed? or would the script have to be written to return an error code somehow?

2014-10-18 17:23:39	micros	actually, this answers the question somewhat.
2014-10-18 17:23:47	micros	really though, the .sh needs to go away.
2014-10-18 17:24:36	micros	anyone any ideas for how a server can pass a few files to update on the local file system?  maybe it should pass a file with each line being the path of a file and its destination, but not as a command syntax... this way the program receiving the file can decide to make the copy.
2014-10-18 17:25:13	micros	of course, there is huge freedom with the .sh should something unexpected have to be updated.
2014-10-18 17:26:38	micros	i wish instead i could somehow install a delta of the file system

2014-10-19 20:11:49	foreverska	if, say, you were garunteed that the bottom byte would always be in use when that block is in use you could use pointer for your bitmap and point them at the first bytes of all your blocks.  Testing the pointer for truth would show whether or not it's empty.
2014-10-19 20:12:34	Troll3	foreverska: for particular 8 byte block there will be 0 if block is full and 1 if it is empty, so I meen how can i link that block exactly to array that probably can be a bitmap?

2014-10-19 20:50:50	Chris	But C hasn't changed much since then, and certainly hasn't inherited any concepts like subprocesses :)

2014-10-19 20:51:08	Chris	Yet you can still learn C starting with K&R, and then looking at what's new in C99 and C11.
2014-10-19 20:51:09	mustapha	Wonder if H&S has been updated recently enough for "their latest editions" to be important to note.

2014-10-19 22:22:33	speckle	in general, what do you guys think about passing around structs instead of ints or pointers? I personally find it clearer and less error-prone
2014-10-19 22:22:49	JosephFerano	or char
2014-10-19 22:23:33	mikelr	speckle: It's generally considered too slow if the struct is bigger then 20 bytes or so
2014-10-19 22:23:42	Zhivago	speckle: It can be useful.
2014-10-19 22:23:56	speckle	20 is the cutoff? thanks! I was wondering about that, but didn't ask because I thought it was too subjective
2014-10-19 22:24:14	Zhivago	There is no real cutoff -- consider what you'd be passing instead of the struct.
2014-10-19 22:24:24	Zhivago	And then think about how clever you expect the compilers to be.
2014-10-19 22:24:25	mikelr	Well it's not strict, really depend on how often it will be passed
2014-10-19 22:24:29	kurahaupo	speckle: if the first thing you would do is create a local copy, then you might as well always pass by value, regardless of the size
2014-10-19 22:24:31	JosephFerano	scragglez: also, your touch comparisons are redundant, use the ternary operator and convert all of that into a single line;
2014-10-19 22:24:52	JosephFerano	my_char = touch == 2 ? ‘x’ : ‘-‘;

2014-10-19 22:25:20	kurahaupo	and pass-by-value *is* clearer; if documentation is important, consider using it that way too
2014-10-19 22:26:28	mikelr	speckle: If you look at the assembler output you can see it will create a loop to copy the struct if it's big enough. This is where the performance drops of fast. If you aren't passing much. If its not used often, the it's probably clearer to pass by value
2014-10-19 22:27:14	speckle	a loop! I never thought of that! it sounds like it would cause a massive slowdown from branch prediction misses
2014-10-19 22:27:24	speckle	though I imagine the struct would have to be very large for it to optimize like that
2014-10-19 22:28:30	JosephFerano	scragglez: and yet another improvement is to make convert all of those if statements to 2 for loops, one for x and one for y, where y is inside, the iterator starts at x - 1 and you check if x < 3, since that seems to be the range of your if statements
2014-10-19 22:28:53	JosephFerano	scragglez: because you’re basically manually writing what could be automated by for loops
2014-10-19 22:29:40	mikelr	speckle: Yeah, the reset of the branch predictor is the one that is always hard to troubleshoot. No idea why, but I saw it once with not too many bytes on x86_64
2014-10-19 22:29:47	JosephFerano	scragglez: also, I just realized, that you’re passing in negative indexes to arrays, I don’t know much C, and others can correct me, but that seems wrong
2014-10-19 22:29:54	speckle	not sure +/-1 is a big enough range to necessitate a forloop.  Personally, I would shove all 8 cases into one giant conditional, and try to format it to be a little neater, but I won't claim I know best in this case

2014-10-19 22:30:23	scragglez	JosephFerano: alright, so I've touched it up a bit. But yeah that was my main concern. I'm not sure how to do the negative indexing.
2014-10-19 22:30:50	JosephFerano	scragglez: that doesn’t make sense though, why are you doing negative indexing? I’ve personally never heard of that in C#, can you do that in C?
2014-10-19 22:30:51	speckle	speaking of for loops, I always get confused about which multidimensional array dimension should be iterated over first.  If you have arr[x][y], y should be in the inner loop, right?
2014-10-19 22:31:21	scragglez	JosephFerano: I'm not sure if you can. I'm actually wondering how to do that myself.
2014-10-19 22:31:34	JosephFerano	scragglez: why are you trying to pass in a negative indexer?
2014-10-19 22:32:32	Zhivago	The good news is that you only have pass-by-value in C.
2014-10-19 22:32:49	scragglez	I'm trying to write my own game of life. So I'm trying to write this function to compare the elements to see if they're both touching and alive.

2014-10-20 20:16:58	Chris	iAmerikan: Yes, but what you're currently trying to do is return a pointer to an array of automatic storage duration.
2014-10-20 20:17:11	Chris	iAmerikan: that array dies when you return from the function, so the returned pointer is invalid.

2014-10-20 20:18:57	Chris	iAmerikan: moves is an array of 4 arrays of 2 ints.
2014-10-20 20:19:05	iAmerikan	Right.
2014-10-20 20:19:08	Chris	iAmerikan: in C syntax, moves[0]'s type is int[2]
2014-10-20 20:19:24	iAmerikan	I'm following
2014-10-20 20:19:48	Chris	iAmerikan: so you should consider a function that returns a pointer to int[2]. The syntax for that is quite tricky. :)
2014-10-20 20:20:20	iAmerikan	where the int[2] needs to be static in duration?
2014-10-20 20:20:47	Chris	iAmerikan: well, you'd declare the moves array static
2014-10-20 20:21:22	iAmerikan	would I still declare the array in that function?
2014-10-20 20:21:29	Chris	sure.

2014-10-20 20:25:39	iAmerikan	would it be better to move the array to main, and make the function return an int to use as the index? to keep it simple
2014-10-20 20:26:13	Chris	Probably not. But if you'd like to continue to use C without understand pointers and arrays properly, then it's probably easier to do that, yes.
2014-10-20 20:26:58	iAmerikan	challenge accepted then. I'll review pointer material I guess.
2014-10-20 20:29:03	Chris	iAmerikan: Well, given your current desire to return like that, something like http://ideone.com/3oXmCu is probably correct. There are a number of better ways to handle it though.

2014-10-20 20:30:41	Chris	Declaring a function int (*get_move(void))[2] is pretty revolting by most people's standards, including mine. But hey, C.

2014-10-20 20:32:46	iAmerikan	I'm interested why the % 4 will produce bad numbers
2014-10-20 20:33:21	iAmerikan	I'm reading C Programming: A Modern Approach, and that's what was suggested for the exercise
2014-10-20 20:33:51	Chris	(1) rand() is generally shitty (2) historically, implementations made the least significant bits of rand() particularly bad (e.g. just cycling 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0... for example.
2014-10-20 20:34:42	Chris	Less significantly, % n will produce bias if RAND_MAX is not evenly divisible by n (which it almost certainly is not).

2014-10-20 20:59:15	zzo38	The program is this:  http://sprunge.us/CIXS  I think the problem might have something to do with the "vocab_lookup" function, due to the bug report.
2014-10-20 20:59:21	Xgc	zzo38: Probably just incorrect assumptions.   If you can list them all, you may get some feedback.
2014-10-20 20:59:21	kate`	zzo38, i do - if you give me some code which is simple enough for me to compile
2014-10-20 20:59:41	kate`	you're not a fan of verical whitespace, huh? :)
2014-10-20 20:59:49	drakored	I was going for ease of use, I know the array size at runtime when filling, but it is relatively low volume (under 10 or so), but it's on a pebble so low memory (64k I believe)
2014-10-20 21:00:19	kate`	zzo38, this program raises a bazillion warnings when compiled with gcc -std=c99 -Wall. perhaps address some of those, first
2014-10-20 21:00:34	kate`	zzo38, the first one is: cixs.c:346:11: warning: operation on ‘pc’ may be undefined [-Wsequence-point]
2014-10-20 21:00:38	drakored	I need to learn when to use linked list versus a "dynamic array" it seems
2014-10-20 21:00:45	zzo38	kate`: Try -std=gnu89 instead then; will that work?
2014-10-20 21:00:57	kate`	zzo38, are you really writing for gnu89?
2014-10-20 21:01:25	zzo38	But you are right about that warning; I fixed it just now.
2014-10-20 21:01:33	zzo38	And yes I am really writing for gnu89
2014-10-20 21:01:36	kate`	super. now fix the rest :)

2014-10-20 21:12:09	zzo38	I can try to put int32_t in, but I don't know if I have that in my computer? Also, it should work if it is longer than 32-bits; the program doesn't require that it is exactly 32-bits.
2014-10-20 21:12:21	kate`	if you don't have it, your code won't work anyway
2014-10-20 21:12:40	kate`	if your program doesn't require that it is exactly 32 bits, then sint32 is a silly name for it
2014-10-20 21:12:57	zzo38	It does require that it is at least 32 bits. It also requires that zint and uzint are exactly 16-bits, though.

2014-10-20 21:15:00	kate`	what's the "& 1" for, in get16()?
2014-10-20 21:15:35	zzo38	In order to check the endianness of the program it is executing.

2014-10-20 21:16:14	zzo38	Also, the program would be much more broken if that part was wrong.

2014-10-20 23:58:55	Chris	The C standard does allow for implementation-defined alternate forms of main. So if your particular C implementation documents "void main(void)" is fine, then it is indeed okay on your implementation. However, it's still a silly idea to use it.

2014-10-20 23:59:00	Seabasschan	"It is because it is" may seem logically flawed, but that summarises it nicely. Another explanation might be "It is because the C standard gods who write our compilers and standard libraries say it is".

2014-10-24 17:35:24	eklo	It's weird. It failed to compile when I passed char * but not when it was void * instead of void **
2014-10-24 17:36:08	fizzie	Pointing a void ** at a char * object is quite dubious, even if C11 6.2.5p28 (and footnote 48) gives it some legitimacy in that particular case. Pointing a void ** at, say, an int * is unequivocally wrong.
2014-10-24 17:36:28	fizzie	(As for why it "works" when cast to void *, there's an implicit conversion from void * to void **, like there is from void * to any pointer type.)

2014-10-24 17:47:53	fizzie	dorp: I would think they do ("char *" is not compatible with "void *", so accessing a char * object via *p where p is a void ** is an lvalue expression of an illegal type), but I've never been very certain what the "same representation -- imply interchangeability" stuff means.

2014-10-24 17:48:41	zid`	why would char * not be compatible with void *
2014-10-24 17:49:13	dorp	fizzie: The bottom line was: "it's just a suggestion" to have such interchangeability, and doesn't actually imply that it exists
2014-10-24 17:49:33	fizzie	zid`: Because "two pointer types [are] compatible [if] both [are] identically qualified and both [are] pointers to compatible types" (C11 6.7.6.1p2), and "void" and "char" certainly are not compatible types.
2014-10-24 17:49:47	zid`	then void * is compatible with nothing and therefore useless

2014-10-24 18:24:07	Seabasschan	zid`: From what I gather, they grow very slowly...
2014-10-24 18:24:14	zid`	as well as being ridiculously hot
2014-10-24 18:24:29	zid`	Seabasschan: It shot up to 4 inches, then stopped dead, the root system is the entire container atm
2014-10-24 18:24:52	zid`	and it's getting very very hard to keep it watered with so little soil
2014-10-24 18:24:56	Seabasschan	How large is the chilli plant stated to grow, and how large is the pot?
2014-10-24 18:24:58	zid`	I'm just too lazy to re-pot it
2014-10-24 18:25:05	zid`	Seabasschan: fuck knows, like a soda can
2014-10-24 18:25:32	zid`	if it survives the winter I'll repot it
2014-10-24 18:25:45	Seabasschan	Ah, yeh... Try a little larger. If it's one of the mini varieties (like the ones I have) then it'll probably max out in a 10" pot or something.
2014-10-24 18:25:52	zid`	I think there's a smaller one in there with it too, if I can extract it mainly intact I'll throw it in the garden

2014-10-25 18:05:04	emperiz	zid`: "all of those look like they are just simple state machines" <- Zhivago wrote that some time ago, too. What does that sentence actually imply? Implementing the exercise in a "state machine pattern" (i.e. switch/case of states)?

2014-10-25 18:05:28	zid`	emperiz: That it isn't directly computing each incoming data point and spitting it out directly like a filter
2014-10-25 18:05:33	zid`	it's holding information for the future
2014-10-25 18:05:34	edk	for the love of god or satan or whatever fucked up thing you care about don't bring "patterns" into it
2014-10-25 18:05:56	PoppaVic	hahahahaha
2014-10-25 18:06:18	likecolacola	Kitt3n_, it's bad in comparison to my native language... it might not be that evident from outside but i feel it almost every time i am trying to communicate, for it takes longer to write and be understood
2014-10-25 18:06:34	zid`	Usually it does this by changing variables that determine which state it is in, which means, it will take a different action next time
2014-10-25 18:06:53	Kitt3n_	likecolacola, uhhh..well. English isn't my native language either.
2014-10-25 18:07:11	emperiz	Hm most of the time I tried the exercises in a classical way... step for step. Maybe that is the reason why I got stuck with a lot of the exercises...
2014-10-25 18:07:34	zid`	so a simple state machine might be "If the ctrl key is held down, and left click is pressed, do x" or "If the ctrl key is not held down, and left click is pressed, do y" but instead of checking the ctrl key when a left click arrives, you check if the program recorded that ctrl is held when it received that input
2014-10-25 18:07:39	zid`	That's a bit of a mouthful sorry
2014-10-25 18:07:53	zid`	I wanted a believable example and I failed to think of something succinct
2014-10-25 18:08:44	likecolacola	Kitt3n_, was not justifying my poor skills hehe... also i never did English classes but learn't by typing and reading... so, in many cases i find myself in trouble because of not knowing the language rules per se
2014-10-25 18:08:45	zid`	so the program would be a loop that gets events, if the ctrl key pressed event occurs, ctrl_pressed = 1; if ctrl released event occurs ctrl_pressed = 0;   then if the click event occurs, we do if(ctrl_pressed) x(); else y();
2014-10-25 18:09:07	emperiz	ok
2014-10-25 18:09:18	zid`	It's basically the only way to implement a lot of stuff if you're operating on a stream
2014-10-25 18:09:46	zid`	emperiz: So in K&R there is stuff like "replace 4 spaces with tabs" there's no way to, upon reading a space, know what to do
2014-10-25 18:09:52	zid`	unless you know how many spaces have been previously read
2014-10-25 18:10:30	zid`	i.e the program needs to be stateful, aka a state machine

2014-10-25 18:15:38	emperiz	Ahhh so there isn't a "space" state, I just have a count state which gets incremented everytime an event loop recognizes a space?

2014-10-27 21:18:49	Nizumzen	ProfOak_: always better to be explicit anyway and set the standard you want to use at the outset
2014-10-27 21:18:52	fluter	ProfOak_, get K&R and do the exercises, you will be getting master of C
2014-10-27 21:19:25	ProfOak_	I went through some K&R chapters before. It was definitely a good book from what I saw. I just jump languages too much.
2014-10-27 21:19:30	benwaffle	are integer constants signed or unsigned?
2014-10-27 21:19:33	ProfOak_	Yeah that's probably a good idea
2014-10-27 21:19:47	fluter	benwaffle, int is signed,
2014-10-27 21:19:58	fluter	if you want unsigned, use unsigned
2014-10-27 21:20:15	fluter	add U suffix to constant makes it unsigned
2014-10-27 21:20:21	benwaffle	as in `if (length < 256)`
2014-10-27 21:21:32	fluter	it's int
2014-10-27 21:22:58	u-ou	256u?
2014-10-27 21:23:06	u-ou	iirc
2014-10-27 21:23:15	Seabasschan	benwaffle: It depends upon the integer constant. Some are explicitly typed, such as 256UL will always be an unsigned long with the value of 256. Some, such as yours, however, will be whichever of a list of types that can represent the number correctly.

2014-10-30 21:15:15	SpikeMaster	I really don't know what i'm doing but in gcc -03 GameRand() is by far the fastest random number generator I've found with a distribution that appears to be really good.
2014-10-30 21:15:30	Seabasschan	SpikeMaster: You're profiling wrong. You need to develop your game, and then profile your game as a whole to determine what the most significant bottleneck is (most likely not rand). Otherwise you risk mistargeting your optimisations, and that might have a detrimental effect on speed.
2014-10-30 21:15:51	edk	it's less likely to have a detrimental effect on speed as it is to just waste a ton of developer time
2014-10-30 21:16:16	Seabasschan	SpikeMaster: It may be fast, but does it use more memory than the others? When combined with your game, is it more likely to cause cache misses?
2014-10-30 21:16:36	Seabasschan	SpikeMaster: The speed of a function on its own rarely reflects the speed of the function in a project.

It's only when you compile your code that speed is introduced, because it gets converted to machine code and machine code -does- have speed. You need a compiler to perform that translations, and different C compilers produce different machine code. Some C compilers are better at optimising than others.

DnD got aroudn this by having natural 20. But the math is still messed up for stacking hit before reaching the natural range.

2014-10-30 21:50:53	SpikeMaster	zid. It forces yuou to put arbitrary caps on hit. And it does mess up the math. Hit should be it's own roll. It does change the math. There's ways around it and it "works". But the math is not the same as separate rolls.
2014-10-30 21:51:03	Zhivago	e.g., if a crit is a top 10% hit, then at 50% hit, you have 5% crit, and at 100% hit, you have 10% crit.

2014-10-30 23:21:24	Jon--	In fact, it's more complicated than that, the issue is a global variable is changing its data between functions, which led me to believe it was not declared properly.

No code that I have written has executed. I come in here and ask if what I am declaring is a proper global pointer to a structure, give you 6-7 lines of code. That checks out.

2014-10-30 23:27:51	kate`	Jon--, i'll rephrase that. the next time you call strtok, you get a new string. you insert() this new string. where does the first node's string pointer point?

In stead of making an array of N substrings, I thought I could have an array of pointers to each character. I.e: foo = "Hello"; In stead of having arrays = {"Hello", "ello", ..., "o"}, I thought arrays = {pointer-to-1st-char-in-foo, pointer-to-2nd-char-in-foo, ... pointer-to-last-char-in-foo}.

2014-10-31 21:06:09	moneycat	does it set the memory address that the pointer is now pointing to?
2014-10-31 21:09:05	CaZe	It sets the value of p.
2014-10-31 21:09:15	CaZe	(to a probably invalid value)
2014-10-31 21:10:30	moneycat	so i can't set it manually to view a particular memory location this way? if p = &x tells p the integer value of the memory address of x, why can't i do it manually?
2014-10-31 21:11:05	CaZe	Your "if" assumption is incorrect.
2014-10-31 21:11:15	moneycat	ah
2014-10-31 21:11:17	moneycat	then what does it do?
2014-10-31 21:11:59	CaZe	It assigns to p the address of x. There is no "integer value of the memory" involved.
2014-10-31 21:12:24	CaZe	Pointers are an abstraction in C. They aren't just integers.

2014-10-31 21:38:30	webstrand	*for me
2014-10-31 21:38:39	edk	ggVGc: power, code space, ram, ...
2014-10-31 21:38:42	boru	I was wondering who -amgarp was.
2014-10-31 21:39:15	PoppaVic	boru:  isn't there a world, (according to?)
2014-10-31 21:39:41	ggVGc	edk: yeah, okay. Not so sure I agree it's an issue for most applications. I have been using lua a lot lately with critical parts written in C, and it doesn't consume terrible amounts of resources used right.
2014-10-31 21:39:41	edk	ggVGc: i think "almost all" would be drastically different if you were in a different field; performance certainly matters enough that people are investing $millions in making dynamic languages faster
2014-10-31 21:39:57	boru	PoppaVic; heh, I wonder how many people got that.
2014-10-31 21:40:28	PoppaVic	boru:  damned few, I suspect
2014-10-31 21:40:50	edk	i didn't - i don't read books
2014-10-31 21:40:53	boru	Aye, shameful.
2014-10-31 21:40:55	ggVGc	I think the major issue for dynamic languages is the lack of good profiling tools, and lack of understanding among its users on how to write efficient software in them
2014-10-31 21:41:01	ggVGc	not the actual speed of the languages
2014-10-31 21:41:52	boru	Oh dear.

2014-11-02 14:29:18	BlackHorn	i'm using scanf_s to scan a string (char array) from user input, but for some reason, it's just getting a null character ('\0').

When i set my string in initialisation to "Test", it ends up changing it on scanning to {'\0', 'e', 's', 't'}. So it's making my string read as null. Does anyone know why this is happening?

2014-11-02 15:08:29	cousteau	edk, yeah, basically the same way as in scanf_s, except that you add the extra arg in the format string instead of the param list
2014-11-02 15:09:09	BlackHorn	You have to add the extra argument? i think i heard that it adds that in the macro.
2014-11-02 15:10:03	cousteau	scanf_s is safer because you have to add the length of the buffer you're writing to
2014-11-02 15:10:27	cousteau	but it's extremely stupid that VS doesn't allow you to use scanf
2014-11-02 15:10:31	BlackHorn	I agree.

And when you register the callback, you can pass an object that will be available as an argument in the callback later...  This callback function signature has that argument as a void *...  I'm not too familiar with what a void* is--- but what I really am trying to do is pass in two objects instead
2014-11-02 15:14:48	BlackHorn	no, but we have to have a visual studio project file to submit it.

2014-11-02 15:16:08	cousteau	so if you want to pass an int, then you create the int, and pass its address to the function.  Then the callback function should cast the void* back to int* (or assign it to an int* variable)

2014-11-02 16:44:49	qbann0p	it is int overflow
2014-11-02 16:44:54	qbann0p	on the malloc call
2014-11-02 16:45:05	qbann0p	hmm
2014-11-02 16:45:08	edk	what about when nresp*sizeof(char*) isn't an int?
2014-11-02 16:45:11	dagle	Also, isn't the response type wrong?
2014-11-02 16:45:26	Austin___	edk: i read that it's bad practice to define functions in a header though?
2014-11-02 16:45:28	edk	it is, but qbann0p apparently doesn't care because they've "found the vulnerability"
2014-11-02 16:45:29	qbann0p	yeah thats where the overflow happens i believe
2014-11-02 16:45:53	edk	(nresp*sizeof(char*)) will almost always be a size_t, but *shrug*
2014-11-02 16:45:54	edk	)
2014-11-02 16:46:25	edk	Austin___: kind of, yeah, but C doesn't have a sane way to do what you're trying to
2014-11-02 16:46:33	qbann0p	what is size_t?
2014-11-02 16:46:37	qbann0p	unsigned int i believe

2014-11-02 16:47:00	edk	or unsigned something
2014-11-02 16:47:03	heftig	The type of array indices, IIRC
2014-11-02 16:47:17	heftig	it's unsigned but may not be int
2014-11-02 16:47:24	qbann0p	just google it
2014-11-02 16:47:25	qbann0p	According to the 1999 ISO C standard (C99), size_t is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit (see sections 7.17 and 7.18.3).
2014-11-02 16:47:29	Austin___	edk: right, i see, i thought i might be flexing a bit when i decided that my application needed something like this

2014-11-02 16:48:17	heftig	There's ssize_t as the signed variant
2014-11-02 16:48:33	edk	99% of the time i find it's easier to roll specialised data structures every time i need them than attempt generic programming in C
2014-11-02 16:48:39	heftig	It's used in some places where negative values indicate errors
2014-11-02 16:48:52	--	DTSCode is now known as dTSCode
2014-11-02 16:49:07	edk	heftig: ssize_t's posix not C
2014-11-02 16:49:17	heftig	Ah, okay.
2014-11-02 16:49:49	heftig	Do you know how it's defined?
2014-11-02 16:50:00	heftig	The same size but signed?
2014-11-02 16:50:40	fizzie	I looked it up the other day, and I don't think there's any defined relationship between size_t and ssize_t.
2014-11-02 16:51:03	dagle	shouldn't size_t and ssize_t have the same size?

2014-11-02 21:54:44	dion	K&R may or may not be a good starting point for a new programmer.
2014-11-02 21:54:49	dion	I think that largely depends on their background.
2014-11-02 21:54:50	Zhivago	jpython uses java. pypy uses python.

2014-11-02 21:55:16	hiptobecubic	yes

2014-11-02 21:55:36	anonnumberanon	what i like about K&R is that it is a small book and it is condensed knowledge
2014-11-02 21:55:42	Zhivago	K&R is a good starting point for someone who has a 12 year old reading level and a basic engineering or science background or mind-set.
2014-11-02 21:55:43	anonnumberanon	I started with Java.
2014-11-02 21:55:52	anonnumberanon	and a huge boring book
2014-11-02 21:55:56	wooster	K&R is pretty solid
2014-11-02 21:56:00	Zhivago	It is a poor starting point for a subliterate moron who likes to pretend to be mentally retarded.
2014-11-02 21:56:12	Zhivago	If you work through the exercises, it should serve you well.
2014-11-02 21:56:14	dion	Zhivago, and assuming that they haven't got an engineering/science background?
2014-11-02 21:56:36	wooster	what about starting with assembly? is that insane?
2014-11-02 21:56:38	Zhivago	dion: Well, they're going to need one anyhow ...
2014-11-02 21:56:42	dion	wooster, some do it.

2014-11-04 23:00:36	jcomito	5. Write a C function called reverse that takes an integer array named x as an input parameter and an array named y as an output parameter. A third function parameter is n, which is the number of values in x. The function should copy the integers in x into y but in reverse order. Write a program to test your function with a list of six integers.

2014-11-04 23:03:00	Zhivago	jcomito: &a[0] is a pointer to a[0] -- that's a pointer into a, pointing at the first element.
2014-11-04 23:03:21	Zhivago	jcomito: So, pass &reversedarray[0], and use that pointer to access the elements of reversedarray from the function.

2014-11-04 23:05:18	milesrout	jcomito: in that case, you're trying to modify the int, so you take a pointer to it. in this case, you're modifying the values IN reversedarray, you're not trying to modify reversedarray itself, because you can't. you don't want a pointer TO reversedarray, you want a pointer INTO reversedarray, i.e. a pointer TO the first element of reversedarray.

2014-11-04 23:28:48	mbrittsess	It sounds like all of these entity struct-types have a common prefix?
2014-11-04 23:29:17	mbrittsess	A bit like how (oversimplifying here) all COM vtables start with an IUnknown vtable?
2014-11-04 23:30:12	tm512	they're all of type struct entity_s, or entity with the typedef, I just need to access the first element of the player's data struct without having the struct definition

2014-11-04 23:38:21	milesrout	you want to assign to y[i]?
2014-11-04 23:38:38	jcomito	y is supposed to be the reversed array, as a "output parameter"

2014-11-04 23:44:19	milesrout	as said above, you want to pass a pointer to the elements of the array, because you want to modify the elements of the array.
2014-11-04 23:44:21	Zhivago	What is y?
2014-11-04 23:44:28	mbrittsess	Zhivago: At least with the code I see and write, I'd assume int x[] is an array of ints being passed by-reference, but int *x I'd default to assuming was a pointer to a single int, in the absence of any other information

2014-11-06 22:11:22	sheilong	most of good books don't cover much about gcc
2014-11-06 22:11:37	Chris	electroglue: you write a C program then you save it

2014-11-06 22:11:45	Chris	The gcc part is: gcc filename.c -o filename
2014-11-06 22:11:50	Chris	You don't need anything else while you're learning.
2014-11-06 22:11:56	Chris	(except maybe to enable warnings)
2014-11-06 22:11:58	sheilong	electroglue:  cc and gcc
2014-11-06 22:12:00	Chris	Just use the GCC documentation.
2014-11-06 22:12:38	electroglue	well I know how to build software with gcc, that is easy Chris. I'm just saying that I'd like to use material that doesn't use visual studio or something
2014-11-06 22:12:49	Chris	Then you've nothing to fear from K&R :)
2014-11-06 22:13:05	Chris	The number one sign of a bad C book is one that goes into details about a specific compiler or compilers.
2014-11-06 22:13:13	Chris	Or IDE or whatever rubbish.
2014-11-06 22:13:26	electroglue	When I was in school way back I learned C++ and we used Visual Studio then I started exclusively using open source.
2014-11-06 22:13:29	PoppaVic	you want the make info file as well as gcc, most likely - and K&R. Done
2014-11-06 22:13:39	Chris	OK
2014-11-06 22:13:46	electroglue	I basically forgot how to program C++ and now I would like to learn C
