2015-04-01 17:02:05	cousteau	Agiofws, that's how redirection works.  Instead of typing directly into a program you redirect the output of one program to the input of another.
2015-04-01 17:02:50	cousteau	rcr, it'd be more correct to say that "EOF is generated by the terminal by closing the input"

2015-04-01 19:29:16	Maxdamantus	Arch-TK: it'd probably be more sensible to replace everything >= 192 with some replacement character.
2015-04-01 19:29:42	Maxdamantus	it should only really be relevant for printing, or converting to different encodings, if you're silly.
2015-04-01 19:30:17	Maxdamantus	one of the main points of UTF-8 is that software doesn't need to be "compatible" with it.
