2015-03-31 23:17:17	Joy	and i used string*, double* in the defeintion's paramaters.
2015-03-31 23:17:49	TheRabbitologist	You're missing something after obtainNamesAndGPAs.
2015-03-31 23:18:29	Joy	in my paramaters for the function or when I'm calling them?
2015-03-31 23:18:41	TheRabbitologist	Okay, actually, I'll make this easy. You forgot a }.

2015-03-31 23:19:33	TheRabbitologist	Hello hapislacker.
2015-03-31 23:19:57	hapislacker	I am setting my weechat am sory for the logging logout
2015-03-31 23:20:19	TheRabbitologist	That's alright.
2015-03-31 23:21:42	Joy	I'm unsure as to how to utilize your vector selection sorting for arrays.
2015-03-31 23:22:25	Joy	I've tried using examples online before but they all use int and when i try to use them for doubles they break, even if I use double for the variables.

2015-03-31 23:23:56	TheRabbitologist	Do you know how to implement a selection sort in general?
2015-03-31 23:24:28	Joy	I understand it algathrimicly but not implementing it in general in C++
2015-03-31 23:24:54	Joy	Lemme take a shot, and I'll post code :)
2015-03-31 23:25:01	TheRabbitologist	That's the spirit. :)
