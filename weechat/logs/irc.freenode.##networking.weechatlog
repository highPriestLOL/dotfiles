2015-04-01 17:36:44	El-Aurian	my question, is how I go from the linux routing drivers to an application which accepts configuration files for authorised MAC addresses, and banned websites (with a HTTP redirect)
2015-04-01 17:36:55	El-Aurian	hence the "format"
2015-04-01 17:37:19	pclover	for the student internet why not use a transparent proxy for web filterting

2015-04-01 17:38:00	El-Aurian	that's exactly what i'm trying to do, except use MAC addresses for associating with the student profiles (for accounting) rather than AD credentials
2015-04-01 17:38:25	+catphish	El-Aurian: that's a fairly complicated setup unfortunately, you will need a transparrant proxy, but also a method to link MACs with IPs to set up proxy rules
