2015-04-01 15:53:18	sigurding	the idea behind in this snippet is the following: you define this map with the interface being initialized via new.
2015-04-01 15:53:54	sigurding	that means you add those objects to a map once, and every time the value of this map is called, the current (possibly new) value is retrieved
