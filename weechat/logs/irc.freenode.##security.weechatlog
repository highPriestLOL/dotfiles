2015-04-01 15:51:22	SporkWitch	Hydrogenum: more importantly, though, is that you're effectively talking about a dress code, which is totally fine.  What you can't do is discriminate based on protected classes, and if we agree that gender or race is a protected class, then what you do in your bedroom with consenting partners is as well

2015-04-01 16:27:37	SporkWitch	PartNAS: there are male prostitutes, you know

There are no circumstances that "force someone to seek a prostitute," while there are those that force someone into being one.  Criminalizing prostitutes discourages them from seeking medical help or police protection from violence.  Criminalizing the clients, on the other
2015-04-01 16:30:41	SporkWitch	hand, discourages them from seeking prostitutes.

2015-04-01 17:44:20	Vexena	Hello, I'm attending a LAN party shortly and i'm researching to find out some ways in order to secure my pc as much as possible. Currently I have encrypted my system drive with Veracrypt already, Password Protected my bios & added security screws to my case so it can't be opened easily to reset my cmos and I made some .reg files in order to enable & disable USB storage. Is there anything else I could do?
2015-04-01 17:45:18	ser_berry	Vexena: I think Windows has network shares wide open by default. might want to make sure that's turned off
2015-04-01 17:45:27	ser_berry	if you're running Windows, that is
2015-04-01 17:45:27	SporkWitch	^
2015-04-01 17:45:29	@TheJH	Vexena: go to a LAN party with friends who are less likely to screw with you? :D
2015-04-01 17:45:34	SporkWitch	^
2015-04-01 17:45:46	@TheJH	ser_berry: isn't that only if you click "private network" or so?

2015-04-01 17:46:12	Vexena	TheJH: It's a pretty huge lan party but i'd rather be safe, not only to securre myself but also to learn about certain techniques :D
2015-04-01 17:46:14	ser_berry	##windows could probably verify if you're interested
2015-04-01 17:46:17	SporkWitch	TheJH: in theory, but in practice they're still set as open shares
2015-04-01 17:46:59	SporkWitch	the question really comes down to whether you're trying to protect against casual exposure, or deliberate intrusion

2015-04-01 17:47:26	SporkWitch	if the former, change the workgroup name, set it as a private network, and you're probably good to go
2015-04-01 17:47:48	SporkWitch	as an aside, your FDE is pointless: it's plaintext in memory while you're logged in, even when the screen is locked.
2015-04-01 17:47:49	Vexena	well I guess I could always clone my OS and then restore it once i'm back, but that's too much hassle
2015-04-01 17:48:22	Vexena	ok, thanks for the tips.

2015-04-01 17:52:55	SporkWitch	Vexena: yup.  think about it: if it's encrypted, you can't use it, and that includes the OS itself if we're talking about the system partition being encrypted as well.  So you need to keep the key resident in memory for the OS to access the files it needs to operate

2015-04-01 19:09:06	SporkWitch	zerobaud: not familiar with xts, but the way a digital signature typically works is you hash the message, then encrypt the hash with your private key.  on the distant end, they use your public key to decrypt the hash, hash the message, and compare; if the hashes match, you have reasonable assurance that the message content has not been modified (this is a simplified explanation)
2015-04-01 19:09:33	SporkWitch	zerobaud: so yeah, as long as they don't have the private key, they shouldn't be able to modify the content without the modification being detected
